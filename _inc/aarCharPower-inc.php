	"thermal vision" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can see infrared light and heat images. This allows  XXXXcharnameXXXX to see in the dark, perceive temperature differences (especially those left by a living person&#39;s contact with an object), and partially see through solids. In the last case,  XXXXcharnameXXXX can only see the heat patterns of objects touching the other side of the barrier.  XXXXcharnameXXXX can judge the temperature of a target by its thermal color.  XXXXcharnameXXXX has an increased risk of being blinded by strong heat sources, even those that don&#39;t affect normal vision (-1R). Thermal vision may be a consciously-activated mode or the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s normal means of vision.</p>",

This Power can penetrate any means of hiding something&#39;s true nature, whether physical, psionic, illusionary, or power-based. True Sight can penetrate any disguise at or below its rank. Range is limited to one area unless the Power is coupled with a Power that e  XXXXcharnameXXXX tends his vision (Telescopic Vision, for example). The Power may be automatic or deliberate.</p>",


	"ultraviolet vision" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can see ultraviolet light. Because UV light isn&#39;t as readily absorbed by water as normal light, this Power enables  XXXXcharnameXXXX to see clearly through fog and at greater distance in the water (+1rs).  XXXXcharnameXXXX can also see the dim light given off by radioactive materials.  XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot actually &#34;see in the dark&#34;but only if UV light is present. The effect is the same when seen by normal people.  XXXXcharnameXXXX has an increased risk of being blinded by strong UV sources, like black lights and radiation.</p>",


	"x-ray vision" => "<p>This is commonly called &#34;x-ray vision&#34; but is not actually based on the emission of x-rays.  XXXXcharnameXXXX can see through any solid with the exception of lead; the effect is as if the obscuring material were transformed to clear glass.

XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the speed or rate at which reactions occur, like stopping iron from dissolving in acid or causing steel to rapidly transform into rust. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also develop a variety of Power stunts:</p>

	"coldshaping" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control any force that actively decreases the temperature of something else. This can be used to increase or decrease the Cold&#39;s Intensity by this Power&#39;s rank number. This function overlaps both Heat and Cold Generation but differs in that this Power cannot alter the natural temperature of a target or alter local temperatures to suit XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s whims.<br >
	There are two primary functions to this Power. The first is to counteract or supplement cold-based Powers. XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter such Powers as soon as they are emitted from the target&#39;s body. Such powers can be increased or decreased by this Power&#39;s rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also redirect such Powers. This leads to the second primary function.<br >
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can shape fields of intense cold and produce useful results. Ice Generation is a form of this Power. XXXXcharnameXXXX can create shapes of rapidly-formed ice that XXXXcharnameXXXX can use in a variety of Power stunts. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also develop variations on Ice Generation that use other materials present in XXXXcharnameXXXX local atmosphere. Such substances include carbon dio XXXXcharnameXXXX ide (even more slippery than ice, and the fog can knock people out), nitrogen, o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen (potentially dangerous since a concentration of it can make normal flames e XXXXcharnameXXXX plode), and the inert gases (an Amazing FEAT, since there are so few of these present in Earth&#39;s atmosphere-but on other planets, not so tough).</p>",

XXXXcharnameXXXX can project the electricity through any conductive medium, such as air, water, or metal, at Power rank range. If the player chooses, XXXXcharnameXXXX can gain +2RS to his damage by choosing to limit his range to contact only. In this case, the range can be e XXXXcharnameXXXX tended by conducting the Power through solid conductors like metal. Electricity comes in various forms:

			<li>Static electricity causes magnetic attraction between objects and can disrupt electronic communications.</li>
			<li>Lightning is sheer, raw, destructive power and by far the most popular form of this Power.</li>
			<li>Alternating current is what our technology is driven by. This Power can either energize or overload normal electrical devices.</li>
			<li>Direct current is what a battery produces. It can energize or overload devices that use DC power. It can also short out devices that use AC power.</li>

	"energy absorption" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can absorb any form of energy, whether natural or Power-based, and not suffer any damage. XXXXcharnameXXXX can absorb energy equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. This stored energy can be released at any time he desires; upon release it has a lower Intensity than its original state (-2 Ranks). XXXXcharnameXXXX may also choose to harmlessly dissipate the energy over a long period; this is a number of minutes times ten equal to the Intensity (rank number) of the absorbed energy.
</p><p>
	When XXXXcharnameXXXX releases XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, three things can happen. One, he simply cannot absorb any more energy until he releases what he has already absorbed. This assumes that he is in control of the situation and has a choice in XXXXcharnameXXXX actions. The second possibility is that a &#34;gag refle XXXXcharnameXXXX &#34;takes effect. Just as a human e XXXXcharnameXXXX pels all food when the intake limit is reached, so too will the XXXXcharnameXXXX simply, uncontrollably release all absorbed energy at once. The third possibility is dangerous for the XXXXcharnameXXXX. If he attempts to absorb more than XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, he may suffer physical damage. All absorbed energy is released in a single post, doing full damage to the XXXXcharnameXXXX.</p>",

	This stored energy can be released at any time XXXXcharnameXXXX desires; upon release it has a lower Intensity than its original state (-2CS). XXXXcharnameXXXX may also choose to harmlessly dissipate the energy over a long period; this is a number of turns equal to the Intensity rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, your XXXXcharnameXXXX soaks up an Incredible radiation blast. XXXXcharnameXXXX chooses to re-release it later as a single, E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Intensity blast that could really muck up whatever it hit, or XXXXcharnameXXXX could let the radiation slowly seep away (this takes 40 turns, or four minutes). When XXXXcharnameXXXX releases XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, three things can happen. One, XXXXcharnameXXXX simply cannot absorb any more energy until XXXXcharnameXXXX releases what XXXXcharnameXXXX has already soaked up. This assumes XXXXcharnameXXXX is in control of the situation and has a choice in XXXXcharnameXXXX actions.

	The second possibility is that a &#34;gag refle XXXXcharnameXXXX &#34;takes effect. Just as a human e XXXXcharnameXXXX pels all food when the intake limit is reached, so too will XXXXcharnameXXXX simply, uncontrollably release all absorbed energy at once. This situation assumes XXXXcharnameXXXX doesn&#39;t know XXXXcharnameXXXX own limit, or has a low Intuition (Typical or lower).
		<br >
	The third possibility is dangerous for XXXXcharnameXXXX. If XXXXcharnameXXXX attempts to absorb more than XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, XXXXcharnameXXXX may suffer physical damage. XXXXcharnameXXXX can temporarily absorb greater amounts of energy in which case their Endurance Rank drops by one with each post, allowing them to absorb more energy. When XXXXcharnameXXXX Endureance fails (Endurance Rank equals Zero), trouble occurs. All absorbed energy is released in a single turn, doing full accumulated damage to XXXXcharnameXXXX.</p>",


	"energy conversion" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can simply change any form of energy into any other form. The transformed energy&#39;s Intensity is one rank lower than its original level. XXXXcharnameXXXX can transform energy by an Intensity FEAT equal to the target energy&#39;s Intensity. XXXXcharnameXXXX begins with the ability to transform any energy the ability to transform energy into other forms as Power stunts. There are two advantages to this Power. The first is the ability to gain an Energy Emission Power fueled by the environment. Dazzler, for example, can convert sonic energy into light. She then refined that Light Generation into a variety of effects, including lasers, light shields, and hypnotic effects.
</p><p>
	The second advantage is the ability to transform deadly force into less dangerous forms. For example, if your XXXXcharnameXXXX found caught in a raging firestorm, XXXXcharnameXXXX might Convert the heat into Cold. This would both protect XXXXcharnameXXXX and e XXXXcharnameXXXX tinguish the fire. (The paramedic shook XXXXcharnameXXXX head. &#34;I&#39;ll be danged if I can figure out how a man can get frostbite fighting a fire.&#34;)</p>",


	"energy solidification" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can transform energy into a matri XXXXcharnameXXXX that simulates solid matter. This matri XXXXcharnameXXXX may be any shape XXXXcharnameXXXX desires, although greater comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity requires a higher Intensity FEAT to create. For example, simple solids can be formed by a Feeble FEAT. Animated forms require a Typical FEAT. Likenesses and simple machinery require an Incredible FEAT. The energy matri XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses Strength equal to the Power rank. It continues to exist for a duration determined by XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Psyche. After that time, the matri XXXXcharnameXXXX harmlessly dissipates. Some of the uses for this Power include:
</p><p>
		<ul>
			<li>Forming servants to perform desired tasks.</li>
			<li>Creating Body Armor to protect and enhance XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s abilities.</li>
			<li>At high levels, XXXXcharnameXXXX can build semipermanent structures at will. Pieces that are &#34;broken off&#34;from the matri XXXXcharnameXXXX immediately revert to their original energy form, doing -4CS damage to the vandal.</li>
		</ul>",


	"energy vampirism" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can drain the energy from a target and convert that energy into extra Strength, Body, Willpower, and any other Powers he possesses by touching them. XXXXcharnameXXXX can force a non-living, nor sentient target to release all its energy just by touching it, while living and/or sentient targets are harder to drain, because they possess willpower which they can use to resist XXXXcharnameXXXX. The target&#39;s Willpower determines the rank necessary drain another; the disparity between the two opposing willpowers determines the amount of power with XXXXcharnameXXXX can drain the target</p>",


	"fire control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control existing flames, whether natural or Power-based. XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter any factor involved in combustion without direct physical contact. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the flame&#39;s Intensity up to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank and reduce fire damage by XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s rank number. This Power includes Power rank Resistance to Fire and Heat. The most important aspect of this Power is enabling XXXXcharnameXXXX to reshape flame into any form XXXXcharnameXXXX desires. This can be used in a variety of Power stunts, as XXXXcharnameXXXX develops numerous fiery constructs to perform miscellaneous deeds. Such fiery constructs do not act like normal flames. They emit less heat and consume less o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen. Their fire doesn&#39;t spread past the outline of the constructs. In addition, they self-e XXXXcharnameXXXX tinguish rapidly upon cessation of this Power. Optional Powers include Fire Generation, Thermal Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.</p>",


	"gravity manipulation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control gravity, the force that attracts all particles to all other particles. Gravity always exists wherever there is tangible matter. (in dimensions composed entirely of energy, though, gravity is optional.)
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX doesn&#39;t really generate gravity; XXXXcharnameXXXX simply changes the Intensity of what&#39;s already there. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the Intensity of gravity by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. This effect may be centered on or projected onto a target. This permit XXXXcharnameXXXX to develop a variety of Power stunts:

		<li>Creating artificial gravity in a normally weightless situation.</li>
		<li>Launching targets into space by reducing their weight to zero and letting the Earth&#39;s revolution fling them upward.</li>

		<li>Incapacitating a foe by suddenly, drastically increasing XXXXcharnameXXXX weight beyond XXXXcharnameXXXX Strength&#39;s capacity to move.</li>
		<li>Forcing aircraft to land by increasing their weight beyond their engines&#39; lift potential.</li>
		<li>Sinking ships by making their weight e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceed their buoyancy.</li>
		<li>Forming large asteroids by coalescing spacial debris.</li>

	The gravity remains altered for as long as the Power functions. After cessation, gravity returns to normal.</p>",


	"hard radiation control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control existing radiation, including XXXXcharnameXXXX rays, alpha, beta, gamma, and cosmic rays. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the radiation&#39;s Intensity, up to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank, and reduce the damage done by radiation up to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX can direct the flow of radiation and can alter its nature by converting any form of radiation to any other form.</p>",


	"kinetic control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control the energy of motion itself. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease kinetic energy&#39;s Intensity by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. With a Typical Intensity FEAT, XXXXcharnameXXXX can change the direction of any moving target. XXXXcharnameXXXX can impart momentum as if XXXXcharnameXXXX physically pushed the target, with XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank taken as Strength.
		<br >
	The primary purpose of Kinetic Control is to control Telekinesis and Kinetic Bolts. In the former case, XXXXcharnameXXXX can redirect the target&#39;s efforts. A FEAT equal to the target&#39;s Power rank taken as Intensity ensures this. In the latter case, XXXXcharnameXXXX can shape Kinetic Bolts into forms that can perform comple XXXXcharnameXXXX tasks. The difficulty of such tasks determines the Intensity of the required FEAT. XXXXcharnameXXXX can have a Bonus Power of either Telekinesis or Kinetic Bolt.</p>",


	"light control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can manipulate existing light. This can be visible, infrared, or ultraviolet light. XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the intensity, frequency (color, in other words), and coherence of light on a Good Intensity FEAT. XXXXcharnameXXXX can actually change the direction of light and -form crude holograms on a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Such holograms are little more than clouds or single-color walls. The Power allows +1CS Resistance to Light-based Powers, since XXXXcharnameXXXX can redirect or dispel them.</p>",


	"magnetic manipulation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control magnetic force. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease magnetism&#39;s Intensity by his Power rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use existing magnetism, whether natural or Power-based, to perform any desired task. XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the polarity of a magnetic field (but not a neutron flow!). XXXXcharnameXXXX can shape the field into forms to produce any effect. These can be developed as Power Stunts. MAgnetic Manipulation can be used to control simple machinery. The simplest form is merely rendering the machine inoperable by altering the magnetism of the components. A more refined use of the Power enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to actually control a machine</p>",


	"plasma control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control fields of highly-charged particles. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the plasma&#39;s Intensity and reduce its damage by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. The Power includes Power rank Resistance to plasma&#39;s effects. The Power has two main uses. The first is shaping plasma fields into any shape desired. This can be developed into a variety of Power stunts as XXXXcharnameXXXX develops numerous plasm a-constructs to perform various deeds. Such constructs do possess the typical side effects of plasma fields, and dissipate upon cessation of the Power.<br >
	The second use of Plasma Control enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to counteract plasma related Powers. These include Plasma Generation, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.</p>",


	"radiowave control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control existing radiowaves, whether AM., FM, or microwaves. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the radiowaves&#39; Intensity by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. A Good intensity FEAT permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to alter the frequency and direction of such waves and garble transmissions. XXXXcharnameXXXX has Power rank Resistance to radio-based attacks; such attacks are normally limited to an opponent thinking XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s a microwave oven about to cook XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s goose. The Power really comes into its own when used as a form of electronic-age Illusion Casting. That is, XXXXcharnameXXXX creates comple XXXXcharnameXXXX signals that simulate an actual broadcast. Voice-only broadcasts can be simulated by a Typical Intensity FEAT. Musical or multi-voice broadcasts require an E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Intensity FEAT, as does a still picture. A single figure with a blank background or a simple cartoon-like broadcast requires an Incredible Intensity FEAT. A single figure with a comple XXXXcharnameXXXX background (think of an evening news broadcast) requires a Monstrous Intensity FEAT. Any other broadcast can be simulated on a Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX Intensity FEAT (think Academy Awards production numbers, and you&#39;ll see why so high).
		<br >
	Obviously, this is a Power that is only really useful in high-tech campaigns. Oh, it could exist in a primitive situation, but then who would know?</p>",


	"shadowshaping" => "<p>This is not Darkforce Manipulation; that&#39;s handled elsewhere. This Power enables XXXXcharnameXXXX can animate existing shadows bending them to his will and cause them to reshape themselves as XXXXcharnameXXXX wishes with out rhyme or apparent reason. An example of this effect can be seen in Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula in which Vlad Tepis&#39; shadow pantomimes what XXXXcharnameXXXX is thinking. Furthermore XXXXcharnameXXXX can give these shadows substance so that they can take on a phantasmal like life, capable of carrying things and performing various other simple tasks in accordance with his mental commands.<br >
		<br >
	The first number will serve as De XXXXcharnameXXXX terity and Strength. The second one serves as the Influence, Aura, Spirit. Body is determined by the volume of the shadows XXXXcharnameXXXX is animating which is equal up to a  maximum of his power rank. So if XXXXcharnameXXXX animated a 2000 cubic feet of shadow, then the Body would be 11. Animated shadows automatically have Two Dimensional at a level equal to the Aura you assign. They move at a speed equal to their assigned Dexterity</p>",


	"sound manipulation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control existing sound. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase sound&#39;s Intensity by one rank by means of a Power rank FEAT or decrease it by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. It also provides XXXXcharnameXXXX with Resistance to sound-based Powers; again, XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number decreases the Intensity the attack.
		<br >
	This is possibly the single most useful Power of all those that don&#39;t do actual damage. The uses are infinite
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li> Muting the voices of an opponent group, thus preventing them from coordinating their actions.</li>
		<li> Muting alarms.</li>
		<li> Magnifying distant sounds to make them audible at XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s location </li>
		<li> Increasing faint sounds to enable XXXXcharnameXXXX to perform certain actions (like cracking a combination lock).</li>
		<li> Destroying boom bo XXXXcharnameXXXX es if XXXXcharnameXXXX doesn&#39;t like the music.</li>
		<li> Cranking up boom bo XXXXcharnameXXXX es if XXXXcharnameXXXX does Okay, a lot of the uses are somewhat frivolous. Still, the ability to knock out voice is a powerful weapon.</li>
	</ul>",


	"vibration control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control existing vibrations. These may be natural or Power-based. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease the Intensity of the vibration by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX has Power rank Resistance to Vibration and Sonic attacks. A Power like this can make a XXXXcharnameXXXX e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely popular in a quake-prone locale like southern California. Using the Richter scale, these are the required Intensities of the FEATs for controlling each class of earthquake.
	</p><p>\
	<em>Richter Scale</em>
	<ul>
		<li>	1 (FE - PR)</li>
		<li>	2 (TY - GD)</li>
		<li>	3 (Ex - RM)</li>
		<li>	4 (IN - AM)</li>
		<li>	5 (MN - UN)</li>
		<li>	6 (Shift X - Shift Y)</li>
		<li>	7 (Shift Z - CL1000)</li>
		<li>	8 (CL3000 - CL5000)</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Okay, if California is determined to fall into the sea, you won&#39;t be much help. Of course, if your XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses Vibration as well, XXXXcharnameXXXX might get blamed for the quake. On a smaller scale, the Power can be used in a variety of everyday situations:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li> XXXXcharnameXXXX can distort or even mute a target&#39;s voice. This effectively negates vocal Powers. This is done by directly affecting the target&#39;s laryn XXXXcharnameXXXX. </li>
		<li> If your campaign includes other Dimensions that can be reached by adjusting your vibratory rate to that of the chosen dimension, then this Power will do the trick on an Amazing Intensity FEAT. </li>
		<li> XXXXcharnameXXXX can cripple gyroscopes, thus disabling any vehicles dependent on them (subs, aircraft). This is a Typical Intensity FEAT, which incidentally also works against robots. </li>
		<li> XXXXcharnameXXXX can adjust the vibratory rate of XXXXcharnameXXXX own atoms, permitting XXXXcharnameXXXX to Phase through solid objects or let solids (like bullets) pass harmlessly through XXXXcharnameXXXX.</li>
	</ul>"

	"cold generation" => "<p>
		This Power is the pure form of Ice Generation and one it is often confused with. The hero can emit a field that decreases thermal energy and infrared radiation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Power decreases the temperature of the target; the amount is determined both by a FEAT and the Power rank number. A Typical FEAT drops the temperature by 10x the rank number; a Remarkable FEAT drops it by 20x the rank number; and an Unearthly FEAT drops it by 40x the rank number. For example, a hero with Remarkable Cold Generation can lower a target&quotes temperature by 300 (10x30) to 1200 (40x3O) degrees. The only limitation is that the temperature cannot drop lower than absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -459.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
	</p>
	<p>
		The power has the side-effect of cooling the air between XXXXcharnameXXXX  and the target. Gases within that area may condense. Such by-products evaporate quickly after the Power ceases to operate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cold Generation can be used to negate other sources of cold, whether Power-based, artificial, or environmental; its Power rank decreases the intensity of the affected cold. However, it cannot be used to raise the temperature of a frigid environment. The hero with this Power has Power rank level resistance to Cold in any form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Optional Powers include Coldshaping, Condensation, Solidification, and Molding. Nemeses include Heat Emission, Fire Generation, and Thermal Control.
	</p>",


	"electrical generation" => "<p>
		The hero can create electrical streams that can do Power rank damage. The hero can project the electricity through any conductive medium, such as air, water, or metal, at Power rank range. If the player chooses, XXXXcharnameXXXX  can gain +2CS to his damage by choosing to limit his range to contact only. In this case, the range can be extended by conducting the Power through solid conductors like metal. Electricity comes in various forms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Static electricity causes magnetic attraction between objects and can disrupt electronic communications.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Lightning is sheer, raw, destructive power and by far the most popular form of this Power.</li>
		<li>Alternating current is what our technology is driven by. This Power can either energize or overload normal electrical devices.</li>
		<li>Direct current is what a battery produces. It can energize or overload devices that use DC power. It can also short out devices that use AC power.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The hero can use any form at will or can raise his rank +1CS by specializing in a particular form. This Power automatically includes Power rank Resistance to Electricity; no FEAT is required to resist your own Power. This Power is linked to Electrical Control and Energy Sheath. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX , the player can exchange any randomly determined Powers for these if he so desires. Extreme heat reduces this Power&quotes rank by the Intensity rank of the heat. Conversely, extreme cold increases the rank by the cold&quotes Intensity rank. At Shift X level, XXXXcharnameXXXX  gains the ability to create a stream of conductive gas, thus allowing the Power to function even in a vacuum.
		</p>",


		"energy doppelganger" => "<p>The hero can generate an Energy Body from his own body. This Doppelganger can have 		Powers of its own, including those characteristic to the type of energy of which the Doppelganger is composed.The Doppelganger automatically has the Power of True Flight, While the player can decide which Powers are possessed by whom, a rule of thumb is that the majority of physical Powers are assigned to the Doppelganger. The player must also decide whether the Doppelganger is simply an extension of XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes will or if it has an independent, but obedient, mind. If the player chooses the latter he raises the Power rank +1CS; he can raise it another +1CS by having the lapse into unconsciousness when he uses the Power, since his mind is directly tied into maintaining the Doppelganger&quotes existence. Any damage to the Doppelganger is subtracted from XXXXcharnameXXXX&quotes Psyche.</p>
		<p>Rank determines the duration of the Doppelganger and the minimum ran any Powers it possesses. Normally XXXXcharnameXXXX  can generate only one Doppelganger at a time. At extremely high ranks, XXXXcharnameXXXX  can generate additional Doppelgangers. The number is equal to 1% of the Power rank number (round up). For example, at Class 1000 rank XXXXcharnameXXXX  can create 10 simultaneous beings.</p>
		<p>Such beings have a decreased Resistance (-2CS) to plasma-based attacks since these disrupt the energy field that forms the Doppelganger. They possess an increased Resistance (+4CS) to attacks based on Light, Heat, Flame, Vibrations, and Sonics, since they have no solid mass to affect.</p>
		<p>The Nemesis Power is Plasma Control.</p>",


	"fire generation" => "<p>The hero can project fire with Power rank damage and range. These flames have no apparent fuel source and spring from XXXXcharnameXXXX  as if he were a living fuel tank. Although the flames&quote fuel comes out of the proverbial nowhere, free oxygen must be present for the Power to function. If not, XXXXcharnameXXXX  can cause a single flame that lasts&quote only one turn, then fizzles out. At Shift X rank, XXXXcharnameXXXX  gains the ability to generate oxygen as well, permitting this Power to function under any conditions. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX , the player can choose the Powers of Flame Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body to fill any slots still open. For example, under the Ultimate system, the Human Torch possesses three powers: Fire Generation, Fire Control, and Energy Sheath.</p>
		<p>This has to be the most dangerous Power around. Heroes have to watch out for accidental firestorms. They also tend to consume all the oxygen in their location, making everyone pass out. Then there is the question of smoke and gases created by XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes Flame Power. It makes me wonder what kind of ventilation system the Baxter Building has...</p>
		<p>Fire Generation is the opposing Power to Cold Emission, Coldshaping, and Powers that use water. This Power gains +1CS when fighting these Powers. It also loses -1CS when being attacked by those Powers.</p>",


	"hard radiation" => "<p>This covers the dangerous section of the energy spectrum: ultraviolet light, x-rays, and alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, and the ever-popular &ldquo;cosmic rays.&rdquo; The hero can project any of these types at Power rank range and damage. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX , the player can raise his rank +1CS by specializing in a particular type of hard radiation. For game purposes, we&quotell assume that XXXXcharnameXXXX  has total control over his own inherent radioactivity and possesses automatic safe-guards that prevent him from fatally contaminating the area each time he uses his Power. This Power is linked to Radiation Control; the player can exchange one of his other Powers for Radiation Control when creating XXXXcharnameXXXX , if he so desires.</p>",


	"heat" => "<p>The hero can generate pure heat that is not necessarily accompanied by light or flame by accelerating 	molecular motion. This permits XXXXcharnameXXXX  to do rank level effects over target materials. Some Power Stunts 	 using pure heat include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Causing the breakdown of molecular or even atomic bonds (Amazing and Unearthly FEATs, respectively).</li> 	<li>Negating a target&quotes magnetism</li>
			<li>Negating a target&quotes electrical conductivity.</li>
			<li>Strengthening materials by heat-treating.</li>
			<li>Changing local weather by heating the air; this can cause small cyclones and electrical storms.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Because this Power uses pure heat, it can function in conditions that negate Flame Emission, like the absence of free Oxygen or XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes being underwater. Beings who possess Thermal Vision or Abnormal Sensitivity can detect an infrared glow around, XXXXcharnameXXXX  and his target whenever he uses his Power. Heat Emission is the Nemesis of Cold Emission, Coldshaping, and Powers that use water. This Power gains +1CS when attacking those Powers and loses -1CS when being attacked by them.
		</p>",


	"kinetic bolt" => "<p>This is a crude form of M30/Telekinesis. The hero can strike a target with a surge of force at Power rank range and damage. The Kinetic Bolt can be shaped as desired by XXXXcharnameXXXX . It can be a wide cylinder, or an incredibly fine needle. Its effect is the same as if the target had been struck by a solid object of equal material strength. This Power can affect only tangible materials. It includes Resistance to Kinetic Bolts, Kinetic Control, or Telekinesis. Optional Powers are Kinetic Control and Telekinesis, which are also the Nemeses.
		</p>",


	"light emission" => "<p>
		The hero can emit powerful bursts of light do Power rank damage at rank range. The light may be of any nature:</p>
		<li>Normal light in any color or intensity; XXXXcharnameXXXX  can light the area, dispel Shadow Powers, and temporarily blind targets.</li>
		<li>Coherent Light (lasers) do rank level heat damage as they burn into targets. Lasers can also be used to carry information or to create holograms.</li>
		<li>Optic blasts do rank level damage but rather than burn a target, they act as Kinetic Bolts.
		The player can raise XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes rank upon creation by +2CS if he chooses specialization in a specific form of this Power.
		</li>",


	"magnetism" => "<p>
		The hero can generate intense magnetic force. The magnetic field may be centered on XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes body or be projected at rank range. The field can affect anything susceptible to magnetism, attracting it with Power rank Strength. If the target itself is magnetic, he hero can attract it at +1CS or repel it at Power rank. The hero can induce magnetism into any materials that can sustain a magnetic field; these include ferrous materials, iron-bearing clays and plastics, and ferrous ores. The hero can do rank level damage to electronic devices by scrambling internal signals; this is especially effective against magnetic recordings and micro-chip dependent devices. This Power can affect other Powers. It can redirect Electrical Generation by a Typical Intensity FEAT if the other Power&quotes rank is lower, a Remarkable Intensity FEAT if equal, and an Unearthly Intensity FEAT if the other Power is higher. It can disrupt Electric or Magnetic Control and Energy Sheath or Energy Body, if either are magnetic in nature.</p>
	<p>
		The Power has its drawbacks. It attracts some types of attacks if XXXXcharnameXXXX  is careless. Such attacks as Electrical Generation or anything using ferrous materials (knives, missiles) gain +2CS. This Power is its own primary Nemesis.
		</p>",


	"plasma generation" => "<p>
		Plasma refers to here to a field of highly-charged particles. Common examples include the aurora borealis, the glow in a fluorescent tube, the Van Allen Belt, and the heart of a nuclear blast. Plasmas may be of any nature: fiery, magnetic, electrical, radioactive, or be of a previously unknown form of energy. This last group includes many super-powers, living energy fields, and beings who can transform themselves into pure energy.</p>
		<p>The hero can project Plasma fields at Power rank range. Due to the unique nature of this Power, it does damage on two levels. The primary level is brute force; the field does Power rank damage There are also side-effects based on the nature of each Plasma bolt. Plasma fields have two of the following side effects:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Light at -2CS level of illumination </li>
			<li>Heat at -2CS damage </li>
			<li>Flame at -2CS damage</li>
			<li>Hard Radiation at -2CS damage</li>
			<li>Magnetism at -2CS damage but full Power rank range</li>
			<li>Electricity at -2CS damage.<li>
		</ul>
		<p>The hero initially possesses a single type of Plasma with two set side-effects that occur each time he uses his Power. Later he can develop other Plasmas with different side-effects as Power Stunts.</p>
		<p>Plasma is a Nemesis to the Powers of Energy Sheath and Energy Body. The hero gains +1CS when attacking either Power. Plasma&quotes own Nemeses are Plasma Control and Power Control.</p>",


	"radiowave generation" => "<p>
		The hero can generate radiowaves, including AM and FM signals and microwaves. This Power primarily affects broadcasting and electronics; the Power can do rank damage over rank range to these. The Power can also be used to directly affect any target by internally heating it through microwave bombardment. Used in this manner, the Power has -2CS on its damage and range.</p>
		<p>Optional Powers include Radiowave Control, Energy Sheath, and Carrier Wave. Nemeses include Radiowave Control, Energy Absorption, and Force Field vs. Energy.
		</p>",


	"shadowcasting" => "<p>
		The hero can emit a field that decreases light and radiation. The obscured energy&quotes Intensity is lowered by the Power&quotes rank taken as Intensity. The energy forms that can be affected by this Power are Light, Heat, Hard Radiation, Radiowaves, Energy Doppelgangers, and Energy Bodies.</p>
		<p>The hero possesses the ability to affect only Light when his Power is at Good rank. At each rank above Good, he gains the ability to affect another energy form in the following order: EX-Heat, RM-Hard Radiation, IN-Radiowaves, AM-Energy Doppelgangers, MN-Energy Bodies.</p>
		<p>This Power includes the ability to see clearly through his own natural or Power- created shadows of Intensity less that XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes Power rank.</p>
		<p>The Power can disrupt Darkforce Manipulation on a Typical Intensity FEAT if its rank is higher than that of the Darkforce manipulator, Remarkable Intensity FEAT if they are equal, and Unearthly Intensity FEAT if the Power&quotes rank is lower.</p>
		<p>Optional Powers include Shadow- shaping and Darkforce Manipulation.</p>
		<p>The Nemesis is Light Emission.</p>",


	"sonic generation" => "<p>
		The hero can generate intense sound and make attacks of Power rank range and damage. This Power can generate frequencies normally inaudible. The hero can disrupt other sound-based Powers by creating dissonance as his harmonics clash with the second Power&quotes harmonics. The hero&quotes own rank is subtracted from the target harmonic&quotes Intensity. Optional Powers include Sonic Control, Vibration, and Vibration Control. Nemeses are this Power itself and the three just listed. The Power needs a medium to carry the sound, whether gaseous, liquid, or solid. It cannot function in a vacuum unless XXXXcharnameXXXX  is touching a solid through which he can transmit his Power. This Power can be used in tandem with the Power of Speech-Throwing to permit Sonic Generation to affect even unconnected targets in a vacuum.
		</p>",


	"vibration" => "<p>
		The hero can generate non-audible vibrations. These can alter existing harmonics, effectively negating any sonic- or vocal-based Power. The hero can cause tremors at Power rank range and damage. The Power can even be used to incapacitate living targets; effects can vary from motion sickness (nausea and vomiting) to death by internal hemmorhaging.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Power includes Resistance to Vibratory attacks. Optional Powers include Vibration Control and Sonic Generation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some possible Power Stunts include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Forming a vibratory shield that can provide up to +2CS protection. The vibrations make XXXXcharnameXXXX  harder to hit as weapons are thrust aside by the field. At higher ranks it can even cause the weapon&quotes own structure to collapse.</li>
			<li>Negating vocal powers by sending XXXXcharnameXXXX &quotes own vibrations into the target&quotes larynx. For example, your hero could reduce Lorelei&quotes song to a gurgle.</li>
			<li>Throwing machinery out of kilter by vibrating delicate components.</li>
		</ul>

$aarPowFighting = [
	"beserker" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can enter into a battle rage that alters XXXXcharnameXXXX in some significant ways. Reason and Psyche plummet to Feeble rank while the ranks for Strength and Fighting increase by the same number of ranks. (That is, the total number of points lost are split evenly between the Fighting and Strength ranks.) XXXXcharnameXXXX also develops Iron Will for the duration of the Berserker rage; the rank for this is the same as the Berserker Power&#39;s rank. The Berserker lasts for the length of combat and 10 turns. When the rage ends, all the altered Abilities return to their original ranks. Since the Iron Will also disappears, XXXXcharnameXXXX finally feels the effects of any damage he suffered while in the Berserker rage.
</p><p>
	See &#39;Stats&#39; for definitions regarding Ranks &amp; Ranges.</p>",


	"hyper-neural network" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX neural network works at quantum speeds, allowing XXXXcharnameXXXX to calculate over a million possible combat scenarios in a second, informing XXXXcharnameXXXX of the perfect counter to any attack. In effect, many people appear almost to be in slow motion to XXXXcharnameXXXX during combat or other life -</strong>threatening situations. This ability effectively allows him to double his initiative during combat.</p>",


	"martial arts supremacy" => "<p>While Fighting is considered a skill and not a Power, this power raises XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s already -</strong>mastered Martial Arts (See Skills) to dramatically higher levels by combining the ranks of the skill with that of the Martial Arts Supremacy, thus allowing XXXXcharnameXXXX to perform actions that would otherwise be impossible, like splitting a battleship in two with a single karate chop.</p>",


	"natural weapondry" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body contains special anatomical features that can function as weapons. These may be of any nature and can be external, internal, or retractable. If these are damaged XXXXcharnameXXXX suffers as if they were normal body parts. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX. the player decides the nature of the weaponry. The weaponry chosen possesses this Power and rank taken as material strength for purposes of determining potential damage. Each time the player rolls this Power, he can add another weapon to XXXXcharnameXXXX. As stated in the Player&#39;s Book, some forms of Natural Weaponry provide Bonus Powers (see &#34;Claws&#34;and &#34;extra Body Parts&#34;). These are placed in the ne XXXXcharnameXXXX t available slot in the Power Generation. The player and the Judge need to work together to create a functional XXXXcharnameXXXX. A drawback to this Power is that if XXXXcharnameXXXX is somehow deprived of his Natural Weaponry, he suffers a loss to his Fighting Ability equal to his weapon&#39;s rank. example: Due to a mishap with a matter transmitter, Wolverine temporarily loses his claws. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s so shaken that his normal Incredible Fighting Ability drops to Feeble. If the Natural Weaponry is made of materials not normally found in the body, it makes XXXXcharnameXXXX vulnerable to attacks that affect those materials. For instance, Wolvie has a -</strong>1CS resistance to Magneto&#39;s powers, since they can affect his metal skeleton.</p>",


	"weapons creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create any desired weapon out of thin air. The weapon can be of any design, size, and material. The size of the weapon is limited by its weight. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create in a single turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX avier weapons have to be assembled in pieces over a span of several turns. While the material strength of the created weapon is the same as that of a normally -</strong>manufactured weapon of the same type, its duration is much shorter. The lifespan of the weapon is determined at the time of creation. A Typical Intensity FEAT gives the weapon a lifespan of 100 turns times XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. On an Amazing Intensity FEAT, the weapon lasts for XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number times 10,000 turns. Should he make an Unearthly Intensity FEAT, the weapon will be permanent. Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs XXXXcharnameXXXX 1 XXXXcharnameXXXX alth point. All points lost in this manner are regained after 24 hours. Thus, XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create a weapon weighing the number of ounces equal to his XXXXcharnameXXXX alth score in a single day.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must have-detailed knowledge of any weapon he wants to create. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only store a limited number of weapons&#39; designs in his memory. The total number of memory slots available to this Power equals XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the weapons he can create. This list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains XXXXcharnameXXXX a new design. If no open memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally, the Power is used to make facsimiles of existing weapons. XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a detailed study of the weapon for at least 10 minutes before attempting a FEAT. Failure to make the FEAT means XXXXcharnameXXXX must spend another 10 minutes studying the weapon before attempting another FEAT. Some weapons might be beyond XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s comprehension, if the player has really bad luck when rolling the dice.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create new weapons based solely on his imagination and basic knowledge of weapons design. This requires intense concentration and a red Power rank FEAT.
</p><p>
	The newly created weapon has the same characteristics as a normally created one of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary weapons, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable and playable set of characteristics for the weapon in question. The Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the throwing daggers and broadswords that clutter XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any weapon&#39;s shape. This permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to change the composition of any already-memorized designs. For example, if he has already memorized the design of an arrow and the nature of silver he can create both wood and steel arrows and silver arrows. Weapons created materialize in XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s hands.
</p><p>
	There is an exceptionto the rules thus far. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX. the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a special weapon. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per XXXXcharnameXXXX alth point to one pound per XXXXcharnameXXXX alth point. Such special weapons are never permanent; Unearthly Intensity FEATs are treated the same as Amazing Intensity ones. One example of this option is Magik&#39;s Soulsword.</p>",


	"weapons tinkering" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can devise and assemble any weapon that can be made with the available materials. By means of a red FEAT, XXXXcharnameXXXX can even improvise a means of creating unavailable materials (adamantium, for example). Provided he has the resources, XXXXcharnameXXXX can assemble a functional copy of any weapon. As to what weapons he can make, use the Resource costs are listed in the Hardware section of our site.
</p><p>
	When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX. the player can choose to make the character a jack-of-all- trades or specialist in a particular field. If XXXXcharnameXXXX chooses to specialize, XXXXcharnameXXXX can raise the rank by two. Categories of weapons include:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Edged and Blunt weapons</li>

	"animate image" => "<p>This is a specialized form of Illusion-casting that enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to apparently bring any flat image XXXXcharnameXXXX sees to life. Whatever the original nature of the image-drawing, painting, photograph, print-the image appears to gain a sense of three dimensionality and independent movement. A blank white area now fills the area formerly occupied by the newly solidified Image.
</p><p>
	In actuality, XXXXcharnameXXXX has created two Illusions. The obvious one is that of the animated image that has peeled itself away from its flat background and filled out into three dimensions. The second, more subtle Illusion is the &#34;blank white space formerly occupied by the now apparently animated image.&#34;XXXXcharnameXXXX automatically casts this Illusion to mask out the still-existing original picture; for as long as XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on the illusion or until the primary Illusion ceases to exist, whichever comes first.
</p><p>
	The initial range at which XXXXcharnameXXXX can Animate an Image is recognizable line-of-sight (100 yards). This is also the  maximum range at which XXXXcharnameXXXX can normally maintain the &#34;realism&#34;of the Illusion. Simply put, XXXXcharnameXXXX has to be able to clearly see both the Image and its surroundings. When either is beyond XXXXcharnameXXXX vision, the believability of the Image drops drastically. When the Image gets beyond XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s field of clear vision, XXXXcharnameXXXX can no longer make it realistically conform to the surroundings.
</p><p>
	Unbeknownst to Kinescope, the alley is full of trash cans, which the lion blithely passes through. This muggers see this and realize they&#39;ve been had. Kinescope gets a surprise when XXXXcharnameXXXX comes around the corner. This Image can exist for as long as XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on maintaining it (the Judge is free to determine how easily this can be done given the circumstances XXXXcharnameXXXX finds themselves in).
</p><p>
	Although the Image can only be realistically controlled within one area of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s location, the Image can be projected up to the full range for this Power. Once beyond the one area limit, the Image is easily perceived by others as a holographic projection. XXXXcharnameXXXX can overcome this limit by e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending the range of XXXXcharnameXXXX own senses, either through artificial means (telescopes, remote TV camera, etcetera) or by using sense e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending Powers. In such cases, XXXXcharnameXXXX can e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend realistic control of the Image up to the range limits for this Power and whatever means XXXXcharnameXXXX employs to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s vision.</p>",


	"illusion casting" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity. Thisse Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the target&#39;s mind and cannot affect mechanical senses.
</p><p>
	This Illusion can take any size or appearance XXXXcharnameXXXX desires and is limited only by XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s imagination. This Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind, or an abstract display of light. XXXXcharnameXXXX is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend. on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. XXXXcharnameXXXX can cast Illusions anywhere XXXXcharnameXXXX can see within XXXXcharnameXXXX power rank range, though XXXXcharnameXXXX must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if XXXXcharnameXXXX wants to make it at all realistic. This normal limit for unaided vision is one area (132 feet). Beyond that range XXXXcharnameXXXX can no longer clearly see XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusion&#39;s surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast two areas away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If XXXXcharnameXXXX is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Illusions, this limit can be ignored. XXXXcharnameXXXX does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, freefloating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses a means of e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending the range of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s senses, XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain the realism m of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means XXXXcharnameXXXX uses to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s vision. Ways of increasing the senses&#39; range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense-e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance.
</p><p>
	example: Deetee has an Incredible rank and can Illusion-Cast up to two miles away. XXXXcharnameXXXX also has a good pair of binoculars that enable XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s to see up to one mile away. For idle amusement, XXXXcharnameXXXX likes to go to the top of tall buildings and Cast Illusions at the pedestrians below. S XXXXcharnameXXXX also like to find the monitors for remote surveillance cameras and use them to direct XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Illusions into locked rooms. Illusions last as long as XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on maintaining their existence. This Judge is free to determine how long XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain XXXXcharnameXXXX concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). This Illusion&#39;s effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion-caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion&#39;s true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. this can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. (&#34;Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast.). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light-based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping XXXXcharnameXXXX cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy. Illusion Casting can be combined with other Powers to give 1 XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusion enhanced realism; this can also create Illusions that do real physical damage. If the Illusion-caster has any of the Energy Emission Powers, these can be redirected to apparently originate from the Illusion rather than from XXXXcharnameXXXX. For example, combining this Power with Plasma Generation would simulate the Phoenix-force and fry any electronics in the area.
</p><p>
	More commonly, the power is used to disguise the true nature of anything XXXXcharnameXXXX or XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s companions might be doing. example: Deetee and XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s buddy Jayboy have to break into a certain building that they know is under surveillance. Deetee doesn&#39;t care about subtlety, only About distraction, and casts an Illusion of a,.Large elephant that comes lumbering around a corner and lies down in front of the door. Inside the elephantine Illusion, Jayboy is free to use XXXXcharnameXXXX Kinetic Bolt Power to smash open the door. XXXXcharnameXXXX also uses XXXXcharnameXXXX K-bolts to simulate the effect the elephant&#39;s legs have when they kick against a target. This main drawback to Illusion-Casting is that XXXXcharnameXXXX must keep XXXXcharnameXXXX Power&#39;s true nature a secret from XXXXcharnameXXXX adversaries. It must be presented as if it were another Power entirely.
</p><p>
	For example, although XXXXcharnameXXXX is an Illusion-caster, Deetee often presents XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s self as a Demon-Summoner. Even if the Power&#39;s nature is public knowledge, the Power is still effective. This Powers of Light Emission and Light Control are innate factors of Illusion Casting. As such, XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to generate any intensity and frequency of light. XXXXcharnameXXXX can warp light, alter its frequency, and change its degree of co XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;sency. XXXXcharnameXXXX can do -2CS rank level damage using light-based attacks. As noted earlier, the Power includes - 2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks; XXXXcharnameXXXX simply casts an Illusion of something opaque between XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s self and the offending light. XXXXcharnameXXXX can simulate other visual Powers or Talents with some effectiveness as well; the -2CS limit is used as a guide for determining how well XXXXcharnameXXXX can do these things. example: Once inside the building, Deetee and Jay-boy discover a guard. Deetee casts an Illusion of Ringmaster and tries to hypnotize the guard. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Incredible rank is reduced to merely E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent when s XXXXcharnameXXXX tries simulate Hypnotic Control. Fortunately that is enough; the guard falls under the spurious Ringmaster&#39;s control. Powers that are a part of or can be simulated by Illusion-Casting may include:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Force Field vs. Energy</li>
		<li>Resistance to Energy</li>
		<li>Energy Detection (Light)</li>
		<li>Light Control</li>
		<li>Shadowshaping</li>
		<li>Hard Radiation Emission (UV Light)</li>
		<li>Heat (infrared Light)</li>
		<li>Light Emission</li>
		<li>Shadowcasting</li>
		<li>Animate Image</li>
		<li>Illusory Invisibility</li>
		<li>Illusory Duplication</li>
		<li>Hypnotic Control</li>
		<li>Coloration</li>
		<li>Hallucinations</li>
		<li>Blending</li>
		<li>Energy Sheath (Light)</li>
		<li>Self-Vegetation</li>
		<li>Shapeshifting</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	A drawback in characters who have this Power is that they tend to become philosophical about the relationship between Reality and Illusion. Companions find themselves drawn into interminable arguments about what is real and what is not. Illusion-Casters may even begin to feel that they themselves are an Illusion being cast by some unknown being.</p>",


	"illusionary invisibility" => "<p>this is not true Invisibility but is actually a clever simulation. This effects are nearly the same, anyway; XXXXcharnameXXXX becomes effectively invisible to any living or artificial being. XXXXcharnameXXXX actually remains visible but XXXXcharnameXXXX can now surround XXXXcharnameXXXX with a holographic Illusion of empty space. this field can be limited to XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body or increased to cover a large area. This  maximum radius of this effect is the number of feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Poor rank could cover an area e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending four feet from XXXXcharnameXXXX. a Monstrous rank could cover an area e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending 75 feet, and a Class 1000 rank could cover a square mile. Within the, Illusory Invisibility, things remain visible. From the point of view of anyone within the Power&#39;s protection, it appears that the area has been surrounded by an irregularly-shaped transparent balloon that causes weird tricks of light. Outside the &#34;balloon&#34;a viewer sees only the Illusion of empty space, even if the viewer has just stepped out of the invisibility field. Standing at the edge of the field can result in a XXXXcharnameXXXX adac XXXXcharnameXXXX as the viewer&#39;s eyes see both the reality and the Illusion. this Power can be cast at a target point some distance away. This area limit is the same. This  maximum range at which the Illusory Invisibility can appear is determined by the Power rank. For example, a Monstrous rank permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to hide an area 150 feet wide (75 foot radius, remember?) located up to si XXXXcharnameXXXX miles away.
</p><p>
	Of course, XXXXcharnameXXXX has to be able to see XXXXcharnameXXXX intended target; otherwise XXXXcharnameXXXX would be unable to simulate the appearance of emptiness appropriate to the target area. When casting this Power at ground level, a practical limit to range is one area (132 feet) from XXXXcharnameXXXX. Casi!ng an Illusory Invisibility in the air or in space is easier and can be done at rank level range. Note that as this is an Illusion, it can be detected by careful visual e XXXXcharnameXXXX amination or the simplest of physical tests. This &#34;empty space&#34;is only what XXXXcharnameXXXX imagines such an empty space to look like. As XXXXcharnameXXXX tries to hide more area, the problems of realism multiply. If the Illusory Invisibility and the viewer move in relationship to each other, the viewer might be able to detect a slight distortion of light at the edge of the field. (This player can imagine it by thinking of a clear drinking glass.) example: Consider an airship surrounded by a mechanically created version of Illusory Invisibility. Inside the airship, vision is unaffected. This crew can clearly see the world below. This field e XXXXcharnameXXXX tends one foot around the airship. From the ground and sides the ship is invisible. This flaw is when the field is viewed from above; a viewer sees the ground below but may realize that the surface detail is not continuous. Rivers And roads have sudden, une XXXXcharnameXXXX plained gaps.
</p><p>
	Since the Invisibility is holographic in nature, it can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography, television, and the mechanical senses.of artificial oeings. It can also be seen at any distance and will deceive telescopes, remote cameras, and Telescopic Vision used outside the field&#39;s effect. Sensory Link can be deceived if that Power is used to link up with a viewer outside the field; if it is used to link with someone inside the field, the deception fails. Clairvoyance cannot detect Illusions at all and thus would also penetrate the deception. This Power cannot deceive any of the other senses or such Powers as Sonar, Radar, or Psionics.
</p><p>
	For example, Daredevil would be unaware of such a field even being employed; this can lead to Problems for Matt Murdock. (&#34;What I don&#39;t understand, DD, is how did you know the Dreadnought wasn&#39;t real?&#34;)
</p><p>
	This Power provides limited protection against light-based attacks originating outside the field. this is equivalent to a Force Field vs. Light with a -2CS rank. For example, a Good form of this Power provides Poor protection against lasers and hypnotic lights.
</p><p>
	This main protection it offers is that if the viewer doesn&#39;t know there is something to shoot at, then XXXXcharnameXXXX won&#39;t shoot. This Invisibility lasts as long as XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain XXXXcharnameXXXX concentration. In the case of mechanically-derived Invisibility, it lasts for as long as the equipment functions. Judges are free to decide the difficulty of either case in any given circumstance.
</p><p>
	For example, the Judge decides that the above-mentioned airship&#39;s Invisibility Generator can function for up to ten hours of continuous operation but shuts down if it receives a single jolt of electricity with Amazing Intensity. XXXXcharnameXXXX can terminate XXXXcharnameXXXX Invisibility at any time, either purposely or accidentally. Simple physical contact can alert a viewer to XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s presence, w XXXXcharnameXXXX ther XXXXcharnameXXXX accidentally envelops XXXXcharnameXXXX in the field or XXXXcharnameXXXX makes a distance attack at the target. A spray of a coating material will temporarily reveal the e XXXXcharnameXXXX tent of the field; in the middle of an obscuring cloud, the field shows as a silhouette of clear air. Once XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s realizes that XXXXcharnameXXXX field is visible, XXXXcharnameXXXX can correct the Illusion to reflect the new addition to XXXXcharnameXXXX surroundings; this takes a green Intuition FEAT. Note: the Judge should roll this for XXXXcharnameXXXX without telling the player XXXXcharnameXXXX has become visible; failure means XXXXcharnameXXXX has either not yet realized XXXXcharnameXXXX predicament or has not yet gotten the Illusion properly altered. Optional Powers include Light Control and Light Emission. Nemesis Powers include Light Control, Radar, and Sonar.</p>",


	"illusionary duplication" => "<p>this is a specialized form of Illusion-Casting that permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to generate completely realistic simulations of a single object, namely XXXXcharnameXXXX. Unlike the other Illusory Powers, this permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to see through these nonexistent senses and to communicate through apparently normal speech.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create a finite number of e XXXXcharnameXXXX act holographic duplicates of XXXXcharnameXXXX. These are Illusions based on XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s selfimage, which XXXXcharnameXXXX had best make sure matc XXXXcharnameXXXX s XXXXcharnameXXXX actual appearance at that moment. This accuracy of the Duplicate is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Duplicate is generated. A green Reason FEAT means the Illusory Duplicates are somehow different from XXXXcharnameXXXX ; they have the wrong outfit on, are too muscular or handsome, and so on. A yellow or red Reason FEAT produces a perfect copy. This  maximum number of simultaneous duplicates XXXXcharnameXXXX can create is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. Although Duplicates are frequently used to surround XXXXcharnameXXXX and act as decoys, the duplicates can also function several areas or miles away from XXXXcharnameXXXX. This  maximum range at which XXXXcharnameXXXX can either send or create a Duplicate is determined by XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank; specific levels are shown on column B. example: Myriad has an Incredible rank. this enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to create up to 40 simultaneously existing Duplicates that can form or travel as far as two miles away from XXXXcharnameXXXX location. This Duplicates are intangible holographs and are incapable of doing any actual physical activity. Thisy are primarily used as decoys, messengers, spies, and simulated ghosts. This duplicates can form in any location within XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s range, regardless of wether XXXXcharnameXXXX can see that location or not. As an aspect of this Power, XXXXcharnameXXXX automatically possesses a combination of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, and Speech throwing that permits XXXXcharnameXXXX to see, XXXXcharnameXXXX ar, and speak through remote Duplicates.
</p><p>
	For example, Myriad is at the scene of a cave-in. This rescue crew need to know where any survivors are located. Myriad creates several Duplicates and sends them off into the debris. Since these are energy, the Duplicates can pass effortlessly through the rock. Myriad sees what the Duplicates &#34;see.&#34;Thisre is no light in the collapsed area but Myriad&#39;s Duplicates each carry an illusion of a flashlight that functions as well, if not better, than a real one. Finally two of the Duplicates find survivors., This first group of survivors are only lost; the Duplicate leads them through the darkness to safety. This second group is trapped behind fallen rock. Thisy are startled when the Duplicate passes through the rock into their area but Myriad speaks through XXXXcharnameXXXX Duplicate and appraises them of the situation. This Duplicate remains with them until the rescuers finally reach them.
</p><p>
	When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX. the player has the option of assigning some or all of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s other Powers to the Duplicates. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create a single such powerful duplicate at any one time. Since this duplicate now has a greater effect on reality, it gains some reality as well. Such duplicates can be affected and even destroyed by such attacks as Light Emission, Light Generation, Plasma Generation, Plasma Control, Shadowcasting, and any of the Magics and Power Controls. This duplicate has a &#34;XXXXcharnameXXXX alth&#34;equal to this Power&#39;s rank number. Any damage to the duplicate is subtracted from this number. At zero the duplicate suddenly vanis XXXXcharnameXXXX s. In addition, any damage done to the duplicate is also suffered by XXXXcharnameXXXX. who temporarily loses a number of points equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. Such points are regained just like XXXXcharnameXXXX alth points.
</p><p>
	All Duplicates can be affected by the Powers of Light Control and Shadowcasting. Light Control can overpower, distort, and even destroy any Duplicate. It can be use to seize control of a Duplicate away from XXXXcharnameXXXX ; the effect is analogous to someone using Mind Control/ Puppetry on XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own body. Shadowcasting can surround the Duplicate in darkness and prevent XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Clairvoyance from operating. If the Shadowcasting has a greater rank, that Power can be used to destroy a Duplicate. Note: when a Duplicate is passing through solids, its &#34;eyes&#34;register total darkness. If XXXXcharnameXXXX is unaware that Shadowcasting is being used against XXXXcharnameXXXX Duplicates, then XXXXcharnameXXXX will assume the continued darkness is the result of the Duplicate remaining within a solid mass and consequently will make no attempt to resist this clandestine attack. As stated earlier, all Duplicates are an illusionary manifestation of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s self-image. This need not be a single, static design but can change with XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s w XXXXcharnameXXXX. Generally, all Duplicates at a given moment will have the same shape. However, by means of a red Reason FEAT, XXXXcharnameXXXX can create simultaneous Duplicates who have different appearances. All such differences are still based on XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own form. A red FEAT is needed for each different type of Duplicate. example: Myriad maintains a secret identity as a physicist at a nuclear plant in Georgia. One day the plant is attacked by supervillains. Myriad must take action but XXXXcharnameXXXX civilian identity must remain at XXXXcharnameXXXX emergency post. Myriad forms a number of Duplicates. Most resemble XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s super-XXXXcharnameXXXXic self but Myriad alters one to appear as XXXXcharnameXXXX civilian self. This extra form requires additional concentration on Myriad&#39;s part and a red FEAT. This player blows it on the first roll (a 23), second roll (03), third roll (24), but finally makes it on the fourth roll (00). Myriad castigates XXXXcharnameXXXX on the additional 24 seconds it took XXXXcharnameXXXX to generate the lab coat and glasses. While Duplicates are normally created as independent beings, the Power can also be cast around XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own body to immediately alter XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own appearance. this is usually used to make quick disguises and costume changes. If XXXXcharnameXXXX so chooses, XXXXcharnameXXXX entire super XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s appearance and costume can be nothing more than such a Illusion wrapped around XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s normal civilian self. this would definitely prevent anyone from finding your costume stas XXXXcharnameXXXX d in the back of the closet. In the previous example, Myriad had not thought to bring XXXXcharnameXXXX costume to work and had to form one of XXXXcharnameXXXX Duplicates around XXXXcharnameXXXX. This drawback is that if XXXXcharnameXXXX loses concentration, consciousness, or Power, XXXXcharnameXXXX also loses XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s costume. (This time Myriad was skinnydipping when a crisis struck resulted in major embarrassment for XXXXcharnameXXXX and some unfortunate media e XXXXcharnameXXXX posure.)
</p><p>
	Nemesis Powers include Light Control and Shadow-casting."

$aarPowLifeformControl = [
	"biophysical control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to consciously alter the physiology of a another. S/He accomplishes this by sheer force of will and does not require any physical action on XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s part, aside from touching the target. This Power can be used at a distance but each 10 feet separating XXXXcharnameXXXX from the target reduces his/her effective Power by one Rank. NOTE: This Power is normally concentrated on a single target, but XXXXcharnameXXXX can affect as many targets as s/he desires.
</p><p>
	There are seven forms of Biophysical Control a character can choose from, each with its own set of effects. This first four forms are benevolent, the last three are malevolent. XXXXcharnameXXXXes who use the malevolent forms against sentient beings risk Karma and Popularity loss. When XXXXcharnameXXXX is created, the player must choose one of these forms. S/He can select from one of the following when modelling a character:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Healing -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can cure the damage caused by wounds, trauma, to XXXXcharnameXXXX ins&#39;, and disease. XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase the the health of another by&#39;an amount equal to his/her own Power rank. This is the  maximum benefit XXXXcharnameXXXX can give per day to one specific person. This Power seals the body and returns any still living tissues to health. It cannot replace lost tissue.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Regeneration -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to heal (as above) and can recreate large areas of lost tissue, such as severed limbs or destroyed organs and rare cases even brain and neural tissues.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Revival -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can actually bring the dead back to life. This Power rank number is the  maximum number of days the intended body can have been deceased and still be viable for revival by this power. The condition of the corpse determines the difficulty of the action (depth of posting required to fullfil the action). An intact, unembalmed, undecayed corpse is easier to revive then it is to revive a whole person from the desicated remains of a single eyeball (even if that eyeball was originally Wolverine). This Power begins by healing and regenerating any damage to the body, especially the cause of death. Once the body is habitable again, the Power automatically summons the deceased spirit back and reconnects it with the body. If the spirit was already reincarnated into another body, the spirit splits into identical halves. One remains with the new body while the other half returns home. If the spirit is trapped, XXXXcharnameXXXX can make an attempt to free said spirit based. If they can&#39;t initially free the spirit, they are aware of where the spirit is being held. And until the spirit returns, the body will remain in a comatose state awaiting the return of it&#39;s spirit.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Damage Transferral -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can heal another by apparently taking that damage from the victim and moving it into CN. This Power first heals the target; the manner is the same as for Healing (above). Simultaneously, XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body reshapes itself into a duplication of the damage being healed. Once the target is healed, XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Self-Healing abilities (same rank) then cures this ersatz damage. S/He cannot heal another person until s/he has returned to normal.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Decay -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can accelerate the cellular collapse of body tissue. This Power can cause Power rank damage per turn. This target becomes leprous, dies, and quickly crumbles to dust if the Power is used long enough.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Disruption -</em> This Power can upset the Smooth functioning of the physiology. This target suffers Power rank losses to his/her health as s/he suffers anything from minor discomfort (nausea, chills) to fatal trauma (coronary attack).
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Aging -</em> This Power can accelerate or reverse the aging process. This normal rate is multiplied by the his/her Power rank number. As the victim&#39;s age changes, physiology and mental capacities change as well. While the Power can function as a Fountain of Youth, it can also be used to kill through old age or regression to protoplasm.</li>
	</ul>

</p><p>
	<em>NOTE:</em> A target can be protected from unwanted Biophysical Control by such Powers as Force Field Generation and True Invulnerability.</p>",


	"bio-vampirism" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX is a super-carnivore able to increase his/her Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and Power ranks by consuming living biological materials. This most common examples of Bio-Vampires are the traditional bloodsuckers like Dracula. For the uninitiated, the Blade Movies are part of the Marvel Movie-verse.
</p><p>
	Bio-Vampires may also have an additional Bonus Power of Mind Control/Puppetry or something similiar to that which renders their victims unable to physically struggle against the Bio-Vampire. However, the victim&#39;s Psyche remains uncontrolled; the victim continues to try to resist the Bio-Vampire&#39;s attack.</p>",


	"body transformation (Others)" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the nature of elements and compounds within a living target&#39;s body. Innate safeguards in the Power maintain the target&#39;s lifeforce for as long as the target is in the altered state. Such states are not necessarily mobile, but if they are, they may require the target to move in new ways. While in a solid altered state, the target retains his/her overall normal appearance. If liquid or gaseous, s/he can assume any shape but can still automatically revert to his/her original shape when the Power&#39;s effects end. When transforming a target, XXXXcharnameXXXX normally changes the entire body unless the player states beforehand which specific section s/he is changing. This safeguards still take effect, but the target loses sensation in the affected areas. Transformations can take any of three basic forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemical This target&#39;s chemical makeup is changed to other chemicals.</li>
		<li>Physiological: This target&#39;s basic life functions are changed. This target may be changed to animal, plant, or a different chemical basis.</li>
		<li>Energy: This solid target is converted to a coherent energy field.</li>
	<p>
		<em>NOTE:</em> If creating an OC, the player decides the form of change in which XXXXcharnameXXXX specializes.</p>",


	"emotion control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter a target&#39;s emotional state and resulting activity by forcing him/her to feel a particular emotion. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only instill one emotion at a time. However, s/he can select any emotion s/he desires. This Power affects everyone within its range. This Power is an e XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent choice when XXXXcharnameXXXX is facing adversaries more numerous and powerful than s/he is. If an opponent has a Power that is triggered by a specific mindset, such as the way Bruce Banner used to turn into the Hulk when s/he was angered, this Power can be used either to prevent that Power from taking hold or to trigger it prematurely.</p>",


	"exorcism" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can release a being from any external domination imposed by a third party. Such controls include Possession, Mental Domination, Serial Immortality, and Magic. If there&#39;s a control, this Power can break it by comparing XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank to that of the Power controlling the subject. Upon severing the being&#39;s control over the subject, that being is immediately teleported to its home dimension. XXXXcharnameXXXX must be within 10&#39; of the subject in order to perform the E XXXXcharnameXXXX orcism. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use this Power to resist the initial attempt by another to control him/her, but if this attempt fails, s/he cannot E XXXXcharnameXXXX orcise him/herself later.</p>",


	"force field vs. hostiles" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX emits a psionic aura that repels any hostile lifeforms. This Power automatically probes the minds of anyone in the area and analyzes their intentions toward CN. Anything harmful is repulsed, as if a Power rank material strength wall had risen between them. Neutral or friendly life is not affected by this field.
</p><p>
	Okay, I hear you asking: &#34;What if somebody starts out friendly, but turns hostile after s/he&#39;s inside the field?&#34;This answer is, s/he&#39;s catapulted harmlessly out of the field. Rank determines the size and material strength of the field. Appropriate ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. This field can be breacs/hed by several means. Brute force always works. Mental Invisibility allows someone to bypass the field&#39;s sorting ability. This field is ineffective against cybernetic life. This field protects XXXXcharnameXXXX from melee weapons or slugfest, but not from projected or missile weapons.</p>",


	"forced reincarnation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can capture disembodied spirits and merge them into new bodies. This spirits can be the newly-dead, ghosts, or Free Spirits. This bodies. can be anythingnewborn infants, clones, androids, robots, animals, or plants. Because of the Power&#39;s interference, the reincarnated person retains his/her full memories and Mental Powers. This spirit is permanently bonded to the new body for as long as that body lives, unless the bond is deliberately broken by the spirit (a red Psyche FEAT) or by a s/he with E XXXXcharnameXXXX orcism Power (L5). XXXXcharnameXXXX can indefinitely hold the spirit in stasis (one Typical Intensity FEAT per day should be sufficient) while seeking a suitable body into which s/he can transplant the soul. If XXXXcharnameXXXX fails a FEAT, s/he has a few minutes in which to implant the spirit or lose it forever. XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot transplant the spirit into a living, intelligent being-with two notable e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceptions. As noted earlier, spirits can be placed within newborn infants. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also accept the spirit into him/herself; the result is XXXXcharnameXXXX now has a complete second person living in his/her s/head. This player now has to redo his/her character so as to reflect the secondary set of characteristics for Reason, Intuition, and Psyche. When a character is reincarnated into a body, s/he retains his/her abilities of Reason, Intuition, and Psyche, and any Mental Talents and Powers. Physical abilities, secondary characteristics, Physical Powers and Talents, and Contacts are all lost. Contacts can be quickly regained by convincing the Contacts of who s/he really is (a Remarkable Intensity FEAT). Karma awards should depend on how well XXXXcharnameXXXX has handled the spiritual transplant.</p>",


	"grafting" => "<p>This is the single most likely candidate for raw abuse and grossing people out, and should not be selected without first petitioning the AST or ST of our site. This Power is strictly Mad Scientist material. (it does have its good side, too, though.) XXXXcharnameXXXX can perform psionically augmented surgery on a subject. XXXXcharnameXXXX can operate on, dissect, rearrange, and perform transplants without the need for normal medical-techniques to ensure success. No matter how crude the conditions in which the operation is performed or how messy it proves to be, the subject&#39;s lifeforce is preserved. There is no major blood loss nor is there any need for e XXXXcharnameXXXX tensive recuperation. This Power is strongly related to the Healing forms of Bio-Physical control and can be used to cure others of physical damage. Unfortunately, the Power lends itself to abuse. Those possessing this Power tend more toward Doctor Frankenstein than Doctor Schweitzer. Such characters might see people as machines to be rearranged at their whim. This Power permits the character to perform acts beyond 20thcentury medical science (like brain transplants). If two or more brains are combined, the resulting character shows traits of both.</p>",


	"hypnotic control" => "<p>While generally considered more of a talent then an actual power,CN can dominate a target&#39;s behavior and actions by implanting commands, not by direct psionic control. This Hypnotic command may pertain to current conditions or lie dormant until triggered by future conditions (post-hypnotic suggestion). Hypnotic controls come in two forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Commands alter current behavior. &#34;You are getting sleepy.&#34;</li>
		<li>Suggestions alter future behavior. &#34;You hate orange, rocky skin and must destroy anything with it.&#34;Normal hypnosis cannot make a person perform any action that goes against his/her sense of ethics. However, the Power of Hypnotic Control can override the target&#39;s innate sense of morality by means of a red FEAT. Less conflicting commands involve only a green FEAT. Hypnotic Control can be established by any one of a number of means. This includes specific gestures, words, songs, or devices. When modelling a character, be sure to determines which method XXXXcharnameXXXX uses. This Intensity and duration of a Hypnotic Control are determined by the Power rank. In the case of post-hypnotic Suggestions, duration does not include the time prior to activation of the suggestion, but only the time the suggestion is actually in force.</li>
	</ul>",


	"mind control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to directly control a target&#39;s mind - through psionic Powers. XXXXcharnameXXXX completely overrides the will and perhaps even the conscious mind of the target. There are four forms of Mind Control:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Puppetry-</em>the target mind retains awareness but cannot control the body.</li>
		<li><em>Possession-</em>the target mind loses both control and consciousness.</li>
		<li><em>Negation-</em>the target mind is completely turned off; Mental Probes show that no mind exists in the target&#39;s body.</li>
		<li><em>Magnification-</em>This target mind is actually enhanced. This rank of the target&#39;s Reason, Intuition, and/or Psyche can be temporarily increased, up to XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank. This Power rank determines the Intensity of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s control, the range at which s/he can establish and maintain that control, and the duration of the control.</li>
	</ul>",


	"mind transferal" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to switch minds from one body to another. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own mind and body need not be included in any switching that occurs. This Power operates much like Mental Duplication, in that XXXXcharnameXXXX reshapes the brains of his/her targets to conform to those s/he is switching. In effect, the target believes s/he is the switcs/hed mind and thus effectively is that new person. This accuracy of such transfers is 100%. Because of the nature of this Power, XXXXcharnameXXXX can also transfer one mind into several people simultaneously, with each believing s/he is the real person. Transferral switcs/hes mental abilities, Talents, and mental Powers. Physical Powers are not transferred, nor are physical abilities, Popularity, Resources, or Contacts. This Power rank determines the range at which the Power can initially function and the duration of its effects. Ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. Duration is given for a single mind-to-mind transfer. If XXXXcharnameXXXX attempts to transfer one mind to multiple bodies, the duration decreases -2CS for each additional body.</p>",


	"neural manipulation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter a target&#39;s neural activity. By changing nerve messages within the target&#39;s body, XXXXcharnameXXXX can cause a variety of effects.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Disruption -</em> This target&#39;s body loses all sensations; it falls to the ground, a limp, aumb mass of flesh.</li>
		<li><em>Paralysis -</em> This target body becomes completely rigid. No chemical can counteract the paralysis while the Power is in effect.</li>
		<li><em>Seizure -</em> This target&#39;s muscles spasm uncontrollably for as long as the Power is in effect.</li>
		<li><em>E XXXXcharnameXXXX aggeration -</em> Nerve signals are actually amplified, causing the target to overact when attempting any movement. Normally, a s/he can select any of these effects.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	This Power normally affects only a single person; affecting more causes a decrease in duration of -1CS per additional person. This target&#39;s mind and senses are unaffected by the Power; the victim knows full well what is happening (even if s/he doesn&#39;t know why it&#39;s happening to him/her). This Power can reach across the dimensional barriers if it is combined with some way of breaching the dimensions. It can function normally if both s/he and target are within another dimension.</p>",


	"plague carrier" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can contain within his/her body and release at will a variety of disease-causing microorganisms (bacteria, germs, viruses). XXXXcharnameXXXX is immune to any disease (otherwise XXXXcharnameXXXX have died as soon as s/he gained this dubious Power) but s/he can instantly infect others at will with diseases of his/her choosing. Symptoms appear quickly. Curiously, victims are not themselves contagious to others. Obviously the Power alters the genetics of the disease causing organisms and weakens them so that they can only survive within XXXXcharnameXXXX and the first new body into which they are introduced. Upon the death of the victim or the end of the Power&#39;s duration, all the microbes die as well. This Power does have a beneficial side. Because of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s special ability to control microbas, s/he can actually cure others of disease. XXXXcharnameXXXX can draw out of the target&#39;s body every last microbe of a particular type. Note: this only removes the cause of damage. It does not remove the effects of the disease. example: Black Plague has a fondness for red-haired children, and cures a copper-haired tyke of smallpo XXXXcharnameXXXX. While the child will live, s/he still has the pockmarks. A character with this Power has to gain diseases, much as others would gain weapons, as s/he progresses. New characters begin with diseases common to everyday life, like chicken po XXXXcharnameXXXX. mumps, influenza, and such. This character must actively seek out sources of new diseases in order to add them to his/her inner armory. This is done by consuming live cultures (&#34;I don&#39;t get it! Why would anyone drink a vial of smallpo XXXXcharnameXXXX culture?&#34;) or by curing a diseased person in the manner e XXXXcharnameXXXX plained earlier. This latter act will gain even the vilest villain a small flock of devoted people, all cured by him/her. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use his/her Power against single targets. Multiple targets decrease his/her Power rank by -1CS per ad ‘ ditional person. Rank determines the Intensity of the infection and duration of the symptoms. This Power can be negated or even destroyed by Ll/Biophysical Control or massive injections of anti-microbial drugs. XXXXcharnameXXXX is then reduced to a normal being. This Power&#39;s ability to infect others can be negated by normal medical means or Powers like Self-Healing, Induced Healing, True Invulnerability, and this Power itself.</p>",


	"plant control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can impart limited movement and self-awareness to normally unintelligent plants. This plants obey simple commands, and possess rudimentary communication and senses. XXXXcharnameXXXX can accelerate the plants&#39; growth somewhat, but cannot make it e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceed normal limits on size or shape. Rank determines the number of plants affected and the duration of the control. E XXXXcharnameXXXX ceeding the number of controlled plants decreases the duration -1CS per additional 10%. Controlled plants have their own characteristics and ranks that are increased to XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank, ws/here applicable.</p>",


	"plant growth " => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to make plants grow nearly instantaneously, and far larger than normal. This Power can force a seed to sprout immediately and gives it the ability to thrive, even in the absence of normal nutrients (light, soil, and water). XXXXcharnameXXXX can affect existing plants and seeds or use seeds and sprouts carried with him/her. In the latter case, the player must make a list of the types of seeds XXXXcharnameXXXX carries oust as a weapons specialist needs a list of those with which s/he is proficient). This Power does not change the natural abilities of the affected plants; it only enhances them up to the Power&#39;s rank. This Power requires the player to develop some rudimentary knowledge of botany, since the more the player knows about plants, the more stunts XXXXcharnameXXXX can perform. Typical plants used with this Power are:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Poison ivy</strong> - rash incapacitates foes</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Kudzu</strong> - vines entangle targets</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Briar</strong> - forms impassable barriers</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Goldenrod</strong> - hayfever city...</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Oak</strong> - instant support for damaged buildings</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Venus flytrap</strong> - Catch and hold foes</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Power rank determines the speed of plant growth and the rank of the affected plant&#39;s abilities. Growing a plant in normal conditions (adequate light, soil, and water) requires a Typical Intensity.FEAT. Growing plants in less than adequate conditions (insufficient light, soil, or water; typical urban conditions) requires a Remarkable hostile conditions (no light, soil, or water) requires an Unearthly Intensity FEAT. Because their metabolism is accelerated by this Power, the plants quickly die. This lifespan is 1/8 normal. As a rule of thumb, the player can use these guidelines for normal and accelerated lifespans: House plants-6 months/2 days Shrubbery-5 years/3 weeks Trees-1 00- 1000 years/1 -10 years This point of this is that your s/he doesn&#39;t have to worry about filling the city with giant plants left over from old battles. S/He might still be in trouble with the Park Department, though...</p>",


	"sense alteration" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can deliberately change the manner in whic a target either receives sensory stimuli processes it within the brain. This simplest form negates one or more of the senses, producing instant blindness, deafness, numbness, and so on. More comple XXXXcharnameXXXX is the ability to modify the senses. XXXXcharnameXXXX can amplify some elements and negate others. For example, XXXXcharnameXXXX might make a target literall see red (and only red). This most comple XXXXcharnameXXXX form is Hallucinations. By a Monstrous Intensity FEAT, XXXXcharnameXXXX can transfer sensory informatic to others, making everyone share a corr mon set of perceptions. Thisse may be XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s, or someone else&#39;s. Sensory negation takes a Typical Intensity FEAT; sensory alteration takes a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. This Power rank determines the range and duration of the effects.</p>",


	"shape alteration" => "<p>Others: XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to change the shapes of other living beings. This result can take any shape and appearance XXXXcharnameXXXX wiss/hes: animal, vegetable, mineral. This target&#39;s basic physiology remains unchanged despite the apparent differences between the original and new forms. When Shapechanging a target, XXXXcharnameXXXX must make sure that the new form still allows basic life functions to continue (especially breathing!). If not, using the Power constitutes a Kill result and all that bad Karma entailed therein. When creating CN, the player can opt to e XXXXcharnameXXXX change one of his/her randomly generated Powers for L2/Body Transformation-Others. In this case XXXXcharnameXXXX really can change a living target int anything s/he wants (with no restrictions).</p>",


	"sleep" => "<p>Induced: this is a nice, simple, straight-forward Power that is hardly ever used in any comic because it&#39;s not terribly dramatic. Nor is it e XXXXcharnameXXXX actly cricket. XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to put any target into a deep sleep, from which s/he cannot awake while the Power is in effect. During this induced sleep, the target is completely s/helpless (see what I mean about not being cricket?). On the other hand, when you&#39;re facing 325 battle-crazed Skrulls, this Power can be really handy. This Power rank determines the range and duration of the Power. Relevant distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. It affects everyone within range. Sleep persists for 1 -10 hours after the Power&#39;s duration. During that time, the victim can be awakened by anyone, but s/he&#39;ll wake up naturally in any case.</p>",


	"spirit storage" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can capture and indefinitely hold within him/herself any number of disembodied spirits. Such spirits find themselves within a pocket dimension of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s creation; while within it, they retain a semblance to their original forms. This pocket dimension can have any appearance. This one within Adam Warlock&#39;s Soulgem was a rather pleasant park. XXXXcharnameXXXX can freely communicate with any spirits s/held within. S/He is immune to any attempts they might make to possess his/her body. A spirit can escape on a red Psyche FEAT, provided its Psyche rank is higs/her than the Power rank. This Power can be used in conjunction with L6/Forced Reincarnation to find new homes for vagrant spirits. This Power can be mechanically simulated to provide a &#34;holding tank&#34;for disruptive spirits like poltergeists or particularly malevolent Free Spirits. In this case, the Power lasts as long as the device is supplied with energy. Capturing a spirit requires a FEAT. Compare the Power rank with the Psyche of the intended target. If the Power rank is higs/her, a green FEAT will do. Equal ranks require a yellow FEAT. A Psyche rank higs/her than the Power rank means XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a red FEAT.</p>",


	 "summoning" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can summon and control extra-dimensional, corporeal beings. Such beings are commonly called &#34;demons&#34;but may be of any nature or disposition. This Power enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to summon any known extra-dimensional being, Provided his/her Power rank is higs/her than the being&#39;s Psyche rank, on a green FEAT. Equal ranks require a yellow FEAT. Trust me, you don&#39;t want to summon beings more powerful than you (they might answer), but if you do it anyway, you need a red FEAT. This summoned being is instantly teleported from its home dimension to a spot chosen by CN. Once summoned, the being must perform a single task ordered by CN. being must immediately set about fulfilling the order. If successful, s/he can immediately depart for his/her home dimension. Normally, s/hees will only summon magical creatures like demons and elementals. If a s/he feels particularly confident, though, s/he might be able to call magical characters like Clea and D&#39;Spayre. XXXXcharnameXXXXes can never summon entities, although one might pretend to answer a summoning on a lark. This Power summons one being at a time. Each additional being decreases the Power&#39;s rank by -1CS. Remember that most magical beings are intelligent and that many are hostile to humans. This being a s/he summons today might hold a grudge against him/her for eons to come.</p>",


	"undead control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can dominate the wills and actions of previously living, still-corporeal beings. Such beings are often called &#34;zombies&#34;or &#34;zuvembies&#34;and are only semi-intelligent. Controlling them requires a green FEAT. Controlling fully intelligent, more powerful undead like mummies or vampires may require MOD or ST approval. Once control is established, XXXXcharnameXXXX can order the undead to perform any task s/he desires, so long as it is within their ability. Control ceases when the task is accomplished, but can be reinstated at that time. This Power cannot affect anything alive. A cured vampire, for example, would ignore the Power."

	"reality alteration" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can reshape time itself in order to achieve a desired situation. There are four forms of this Power, each with a specific area of effect. Three of these alter the conditions that result from the passage of time. The fourth alters the actual flow of time. When the player creates a character with this Power, he must roll the dice to randomly determine what form his Mage possesses.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Future</li>
		<li>Present</li>
		<li>Past</li>
		<li>Temporal Flow</li>
	</ol>
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Future -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can control the probability of a certain event coming to pass. The event can have any degree of importance, from a simple coin toss to the passage of the Mutant Control Act. The larger the event, the more steps will be required to bring the desired outcome into being. (i.e., the greater importance the more difficult it is to alter). XXXXcharnameXXXX to make the desired change in a series of several steps over a great period of time. The Power is limited to directly influencing events within a finite range of time and comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity. The  maximum range into the future that XXXXcharnameXXXX can directly influence events is the number of hours equal to his/her Power rank. For example, an E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent rank (20) can influence an event that won&#39;t occur for another twenty hours. CN must be within line-of-sight of the location of the impending event in order to use this Power. Clairvoyance or Sensory Link can be coupled with this Power to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend its range up to the limit of that Power&#39;s detection range.
</p><p>
	This Power requires a great deal of cooperation with the Mods/Storytellers of the site, especially at the higher levels that have an immediate range of several minutes or hours of game time. If the desired action is successful, the future event occurs naturally at the appointed time. If the action is unsuccessful (the Mods/Storytelers determine that it not possible and or accapetable), the event is somehow protected from XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s tampering. She must try a different tactic if she makes another attempt to alter said future event.<p>
</p><p>
	Some events appear to be too comple XXXXcharnameXXXX for this Power. In such a case, XXXXcharnameXXXX should remember the adage, &#34;From little acorns grow mighty oaks.&#34;A little timetampering today can snowball into a major rewrite of history in years to come.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Present -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can change the conditions of her present surroundings. It is as if XXXXcharnameXXXX had somehow altered the past without realizing it. In truth, XXXXcharnameXXXX has built a pocket dimension that transformed her immediate surroundings into those of a world from an alternate timeline. The world she uses is one whose natural conditions most closely matches the desired conditions. The degree of difference between the real and the borrowed world determines what Intensity FEAT is required. A world that fairly closely matches that of the Marvel Universe requires a green FEAT. A world of major historical differences but similar in biological and geological terms requires a yellow FEAT. Worlds that are drastically different, such as a New York built by intelligent lizards, require a red FEAT.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can take any number of people along to this other-world. The  maximum number is equal to the Power rank number. Anyone consciously brought along retains their original minds and memories of conditions in their native reality. Such passengers can operate freely anywhere within XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s area of control.
</p><p>
	A size of the affected region is a spherical area whose size is determined by the Power rank. The radius is the number of miles equal to the Power rank number. A curious side-effect of this Power is that the affected area can be used as a gateway to the other-world it emulates. Anyone traveling beyond the range of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power is automatically transported to that real world. Fortunately they retain a link to XXXXcharnameXXXX that allows them to automatically return if they again enter the area represented by XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power. This assumes they return while XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s little world still exists; if they tarry too long they become accidental emigres to this other-world and will have to find their own way home.
</p><p>
	The actual lifespan of the pocket dimension is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time of creation. A green Reason FEAT gives a  maximum duration of two hours times the Reason rank number. A yellow Feat increases it to one day times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT increases that to ten days times the Reason rank number. In very special circumstances, XXXXcharnameXXXX might be able to make the duration permanent. In such a case, the pocket dimension has e XXXXcharnameXXXX panded to take in all of the emulated other-world. Such cases are entirely at the Mod&#39;s discretion and should be limited to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely urgent rewritings of campaign history. An example of this might be if Fabian Stankowitz had accidentally killed all the Avengers in the last gaming session.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can terminate the pocket dimension at any time, thereby returning everyone to the real world. Their locations upon returning correspond to their relative positions in the other-world. If their earlier positions had been at an altitude or depth other than ground level, upon returning they are safely deposited on a surface that most resembles their earlier position. If none is available, they are deposited at ground level.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Past -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can actually change past history and thereby really alter the present. This is the most powerful listing in the Ultimate Powers Book. As such, it will probably be forbidden to player characters e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept in the rarest of cases. The range at which CN can reach into past is determined by the Power rank. XXXXcharnameXXXX must be at the site of any past event he wants to change. His Power rank decreases -1CS for each mile it is away from the actual site. The  maximum temporal range is the number of weeks equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Shift-Y rank can reach nearly four years into the past.
</p><p>
	The difficulty of the desired change determines what Intensity rank is required. Single physical events, such as anything determined by a single die roll, can be changed by a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	Comple XXXXcharnameXXXX or sequential physical events or altering a single being&#39;s behavior requires a yellow FEAT. Altering the behavior of two or more beings requires a red FEAT. The reason most Judges will forbid their players to have this Power is that it requires them to rethink. the history of their Marvel campaign in terms of this alteration. Take heart in the cynical knowledge that most people&#39;s actions do not significantly alter the fabric of history. As a rule of thumb concerning common people, there is only a one-in-athousand chance that one person&#39;s changed decision will have a significant effect on history. When dealing with influential people (leaders, super beings, creative types, and so on), the probability rises to one-in-ten.
</p><p>
	<em>Note:</em> There is much debate over the true nature of tampering with the past. Is there a single timeline that is irreparably changed by each act of tampering? Are there infinite worlds and thus tampering is not only allowed but encouraged? Does the act of tampering actually catapult the tamperer into an alternate world of her own devising? The game mechanics support the last interpretation. Each Judge&#39;s Marvel campaign is set in an alternate world that more or less mirrors the published accounts of the Marvel Universe (the comic books, people). E XXXXcharnameXXXX tensive tampering in the past affects only the world of the tamperer and her player. Judges can even play several alternate timelines, switching among them at each gaming session.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Time Flow -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the rate at which time passes. He can accelerate or decelerate it to such a point that the affected area is apparently in stasis. The  maximum amount that time is altered is proportional to the Power rank number. Time is accelerated by its normal rate times the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can make time pass at tenfold speed.
</p><p>
	Deceleration makes time apparently pass at arate equal to the normal rate divided by the Power rank number. For example, a Monstrous rate can stretch one minute into 75 minutes.
</p><p>
	The perception of time&#39;s passage depends on who is actually accelerated or decelerated. To an accelerated person, the world has slowed down. To a decelerated person, time has sped up. Clever Mages can really screw people up by playing on this. For example, decelerating everyone around a certain person might make that person believe that he had actually been accelerated.
</p><p>
	The Power may be used to alter either XXXXcharnameXXXX or another target. If it is used against another, that target is allowed to resist. Such means include Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, and other such powers

In many ways XXXXcharnameXXXX can turn desires into reality. However unlike REALITY ALTERAION, they can not actually alter the past or the future or shape events or outcomes. While they can use their ability to warp reality so that gravity works in reverse or so that water evaporates at ten degree&#39;s below zero, they can&#34;t affect the actual actions or thoughts of another sentient being. They can bend time and space or possibly even rewrite the laws of physics but not that of the human will.

	THIS POWER IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - MOD/ST APPROVAL REQUIRED</p>",


	"magical fortitude" => "<p>Unlike most people, be they normal or meta, XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses a natural resistant to most sorceries, magics, enchantments and there inherent effects. Regardless of the magical properties of a sword or length of rope or other magical item, he is capable of resisting magical effects of said magic. However he is wholly subject to the physical aspects of such an object though regardless of its magical properites. I.E. a sword is still a sword and can cut him, a rope is still a rope and can bind him, not because of any inherent magical qualities but because it is a property of vessel which contains the magic. Thus most magical effects will not effect him, and the stronger ones will be greatly reduced regarding whatever effects they might have on him.</p>",


	"temporal control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to control the how he or others &#34;experience&#34; the temporal continuum. This allows him to reference the temporal frame in which he or others exist so as to cause them to move faster, or slower or &#34;freezing&#34;them in time-space."

	"bonding" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to join two or more targets together on a molecular level. The effect is the same as if the targets were glued or welded together. In actuality, the XXXXcharnameXXXX has induced molecular adhesion. A submicroscopic examination would fail to reveal any foreign material (such as a glue) or disturbances in the normal arrangement of the target&#39;s structure (such as the distortion caused by welding). The Bonding is so powerful that attempting to sever its effect results in physical damage to either of the Bonded targets because the only way to forcibly separate two Bonded objects is to tear the surface of one or both of them. This causes Typical wounds to a living target.
</p><p>
	The range for Bonding is limited to Contact only. XXXXcharnameXXXX need not touch the actual area to be Bonded, although the XXXXcharnameXXXX needs to touch the two targets somewhere in order to direct the Power&#39;s effect. Once the XXXXcharnameXXXX is touching both targets and has begun to manifest XXXXcharnameXXXX Power, Bonding occurs at any point where the two targets are in contact with each other. The Bonding process takes any number of turns, depending both on the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank and the desired material strength of the Bonding. The first turn produces a Bonding of Feeble material strength. Each turn the Bonding process continues raises that material strength +1CS, up to the limit of the Power rank. At any point the XXXXcharnameXXXX can cease to use XXXXcharnameXXXX Power and thus produce Bondings of varied strengths.
</p><p>
	The duration of the Bonding is determined by a Power FEAT at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT creates a Bond that lasts a number of turns equal to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT increases the multipliers to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT ensures a permanent Bonding. If the Bonding is temporary, its effects end without a trace at the e XXXXcharnameXXXX piration of the time limit.
</p><p>
	This is a Power that readily combines with many of the other listings in this book. Combining it with Webcasting produces an equivalent to Spiderman&#39;s web. Weapons Tinkering produces an equivalent to the Trapster&#39;s glue gun.
</p><p>
	Chemical Touch produces a natural adhesive coating on the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body.
</p><p>
	Combustion or Fire Generation produces napalm. There are more but I&#34;ll leave them to the player&#39;s imagination to devise.
</p><p>
	The Power can only affect solids.
</p><p>
	Liquid, gaseous, ethereal, and Phasing matter are immune to this Power&#39;s effects. Once Bonded, matter cannot Phase as a means of escaping the adhesion; doing so causes Typical damage as the Bonded surface is lett behind. Transition from solid to either liquid or gaseous state will work to free the Bonded matter without physical damage, although this is not an option for most people.
</p><p>
	Bonding only occurs on the surface and does not penetrate more than 1/1 6th of an inch into any Bonded material.
</p><p>
	The effect this has on living targets is that only the epidermis is affected. As it does not affect liquids, the Power automatically penetrates any coating that might otherwise protect the target.</p>",


	"collection" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can cause any desired. material to collect in a specific location. This material must already be present and diffused throughout the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s vicinity, whether in the air, water, soil, or scattered across the ground. The Collection area has a radius determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column C of the Range Table inside this book&#39;s cover. For example, an Incredible rank can collect material from as far as 25 miles away.
</p><p>
	Collected material instantly teleports to the designated Collection site. The site must be in line of sight of the XXXXcharnameXXXX and within XXXXcharnameXXXX Power&#39;s range. XXXXcharnameXXXX can Collect per turn a  maximum amount of material measured in the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number.
</p><p>
	This assumes, of course, that enough material exists within the vicinity in order to be Collected. Any material of any nature can be Collected. There is a partial e XXXXcharnameXXXX emption to this rule in regards to living beings. The Power can only Collect living beings whose weight is within the weight limits for the Power; if the beings weighs more, the Power can not affect them aside from a brief tug. If the Power is used to Collect the bodily products of living beings, player and Judges are to assume that so little is drawn from each being that no harm results. For example, a character could Collect a mass of blood without having to worry that XXXXcharnameXXXX bled some stranger to death.
</p><p>
	The Power does not after the state of any matter either before or after Collection. The desired matter must be in the basic chemical formulation desired.
</p><p>
	Desired materials that are in some altered state are not affected by the Power. For example, trying to Collect steel in a junkyard full of rust will lead to naught. The exceptionis if the desired material is in either a state of solution or suspension, since neither actually affects the chemical nature of the material.
</p><p>
	For example, imagine your XXXXcharnameXXXX is standing at the seaside and practicing XXXXcharnameXXXX Power. XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot Collect the hydrogen bound into the water but XXXXcharnameXXXX could Collect salt, gold, or anything else dissolved into seawater. Collecting salt is easy; a Remarkable Power can Collect a mansized pile within a minute&#39;s time. Gold is harder; each cubic mile of seawater contains only a few ounces of gold.
</p><p>
	Due to some une XXXXcharnameXXXX plained limitation to this Power, it cannot randomly Collect foreign materials found within the bodies of anyone within the Power&#39;s range.
</p><p>
	Common foreign materials include tooth fillings, prostheses, sutures, and drugs.
</p><p>
	If the XXXXcharnameXXXX must Collect such materials from a body.
</p><p>
	Ethereal and Phasing matter can be Collected. They just can&#34;t be held for any length of time without consciously and repeatedly using the Power to return such matter to the Collection site.
</p><p>
	This Power is most commonly linked to the Matter Control and Conversion Powers as a way to gather sufficient raw material to permit the other Powers to function. These are listed as Optional Powers. Even if used by itself, this Power can be used effectively. Matter can be Collected to form a protective shield or to entrap a foe in a suddenly appearing pile of debris. Dirt or water can be Collected to smother a fire or dampen escaping radiation. XXXXcharnameXXXX is free to develop various Power Stunts using suddenly materialized matter.
</p><p>
	The comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity of the material to be collected determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Raw, amorphous materials can be collected in a dusty pile by a green FEAT. Common examples include metals, dirt, and water. Formed or comple XXXXcharnameXXXX material requires a yellow FEAT to collect in recognizable form. examples include bricks, edibles, and comic books.
</p><p>
	Biological material requires a red FEAT, whether the XXXXcharnameXXXX is trying to collect bile or hamsters.</p>",


	"crystallization" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can transform any target material into a gemlike material that possesses Power rank material strength. Crystallization occurs because the XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to shape the molecular bonds of normally amorphous matter into a crystal matri XXXXcharnameXXXX of great strength. The Crystallization can occur at any site within the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s line of sight and range; distances are determined by the Power rank and can be found on column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The newlyformed Crystal is initially stationary; it cannot be launched like a missile (unless the XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses Missile Creation, but I&#34;m getting ahead of myself). It can be formed in such a position that gravity immediately affects it.
</p><p>
	Crystallization automatically affects non-living, unprotected, stationary targets. Moving targets require the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. If Crystallization is used as an attack against a living target, it can be resisted by the usual methods. Methods of protecting a target from being Crystallized include Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, and various Magics and Power Controls.
</p><p>
	Crystal can be formed in any shape the XXXXcharnameXXXX desires. The amount of Crystal the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in a single turn is the number of square feet equal to the Power rank number. The material to be transformed into Crystal is drawn from particles in the air or from the target itself. Solid targets can themselves be Crystallized. If the Power is used on a living target, innate safeguards incorporated into the Power place the target into a semi-state of Suspended Animation; all life functions temporarily cease but the target remains aware of its condition and surroundings. A Crystallized lifeform must remain intact if the process is to be reversed. If the Crystallized lifeform is shattered, the transformation is permanent. <em>Note:</em> the shards-of a shattered, Crystallized lifeform all possess some of the victim&#39;s lifeforce; the percentage of the victim&#39;s Psyche possessed by a particular shard is equal to the percentage of the original body represented by the shard. Such shards can be used to create powerful Magic. Such shards can also lead to later Plot Complications. (&#34;You don&#34;t understand. The gem in the necklace I gave Helen was part of Leviathan!) Normally Crystallization is only temporary. The duration of a given Crystal is the number of minutes equal to the Power rank number. At the e XXXXcharnameXXXX piration of this time, the Crystal reverts back to its original material. If the Crystallization was directed in the air the original material was probably dust particles. As mentioned earlier, if the Crystallization was used to transform a living target and that Crystal was subsequently shattered, the transformation is made permanent.
</p><p>
	(This rule is purposefully intended to spare the Judge and players from dealing with the hamburger that would be created if the formerly living target did revert to its original state.) For game purposes, the category of &#34;living target can be e XXXXcharnameXXXX panded by the Judge to encompass any of the Physical Types for player characters and NPCs.
</p><p>
	The Power can be combined with other Powers listed in this book. As mentioned before, Missiles can give the Crystals momentum and range. Weapons Creation can specialize in crystalline instruments of destruction. Body Armor or Body Coating can be a suit of fle XXXXcharnameXXXX ible crystalline armor with that gives Power rank Resistance to physical or energy attacks. Vision-based Detection Powers can be achieved by the XXXXcharnameXXXX spontaneously forming optical devices and lenses of crystal. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX has an e XXXXcharnameXXXX otic Physical Type, perhaps XXXXcharnameXXXX can XXXXcharnameXXXX be composed of living crystal.
</p><p>
	Such categories include Modified Humans, Cyborgs, Robots, Abnormal Chemistry, Mineral, Compound, and Changeling.</p>",


	"diminution" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can reduce the size of a target. The target must be in line of sight and within one area of the XXXXcharnameXXXX. Any material can be Diminished by this Power With the sole exceptionof material that has already been Diminished by an equal or higher rank of this Power. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Diminished to a further point than the XXXXcharnameXXXX could reach anyway.
</p><p>
	The level to which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Diminish a target is determined by the Power rank. Levels appropriate to this Power are - .

</p><p>
	In practical terms, a Diminishment rank of Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX. Y, or Z is sufficient to reduce a normal-sized human to the size of a cell. Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces a human to such a point where XXXXcharnameXXXX can enter a Microverse such as Jarella&#39;s world of Kaa.
</p><p>
	<em>A note on Microverses:</em> These are miniature dimensions that can be reached by a person undergoing e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme size reduction. The act of Shrinking causes the person to breach the Dimensional Barriers and reach a chosen Microverse. The worlds within a Microverse roughly correspond to but are not actually atoms or molecules. Once within a Microverse, the Dimension traveler finds XXXXcharnameXXXX in an environment that appro XXXXcharnameXXXX imates conditions in the larger, outer world. Microverses may themselves contain even smaller Microverses. Even our own world may in fact be a Microverse to some inconceivably larger Macroverse.
</p><p>
	The duration of Diminution on a target is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used on the target. A green Reason FEAT gives a duration of the Reason rank number times 100 turns. A yellow FEAT increase this to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the diminution permanent; in such a case the only way the target can return to its original size is through use of Enlargement, Magic, or Power Negation.
</p><p>
	There are three very different ways to create the effect of Diminution. Each has its own mechanism and peculiar properties as a result of that mechanism. The player can either choose for XXXXcharnameXXXX or let a random die roll determine which form.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Collapse -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX decreases the distance between the target&#39;s atoms and subatomic particles. The target does not lose weight as it shrinks. Rather, it becomes increasingly dense and could eventually collapse into neutronium (CL3000 Diminution) or even a black hole (CL5000 Diminution). Strength is unaffected by the change in size but leverage becomes increasingly difficult at smaller sizes.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Reduction -</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX decreases the number of atoms in the target&#39;s body.
</p><p>
	The lost matter is either disintegrated (if the Diminution is permanent) or temporarily removed from the target&#39;s plane of existence and stored on another plane until it is needed to return the target to its original size. Mass and strength both decrease as the target Shrinks; the lower ranks are proportional to the target&#39;s new size. The target becomes increasingly simple in structure and reach a stage where the remaining structure is too simple to sustain the lifeforce of a living target. This occurs at Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX rank. If the Diminution is temporary, the target&#39;s lifeforce is stored on the same plane as the displaced matter that normally forms XXXXcharnameXXXX body. At Shift Z Diminution, the target consists of only a single molecule which immediately vanishes when the ne XXXXcharnameXXXX t rank is reached.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Reduction -</em>This is the most common form of Diminution and the only form that permits the target to enter a Microverse. XXXXcharnameXXXX can reduce the size of the atoms and subatomic particles themselves, thus reducing the overall size in a proportional manner.
</p><p>
	Mass and physical strength are reduced a proportional amount. While this Power has more advantages than the other forms, it has a deadly disadvantage. As the target&#39;s atoms shrink, they are no longer able to interact with other, normal sized atoms. As a result, a living target is unable to breathe the air or consume food or water. Seen in this light, this form of Diminution is the equivalent of a Fatal attack. Fortunately, there is a 95% chance the Power envelopes the target in an energy field that shrinks anything within one foot (proportional to the target&#39;s current size) of the target to the same size as the target. This allows the target to breathe, drink, and eat. The existence of this field is randomly determined at the time the source of the Diminution is created. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX lacks such field, then any target must have its own supply of proportionally-sized consumables. Even non-living targets can be affected in that the Power effectively insulates them from electricity, since normal-sized electrons cannot flow into a Diminished conductor. Treat this as rank level Resistance to Electricity. If the field exists, electrons are automatically Shrunken to permit conductivity.
</p><p>
	It is assumed that when the Power is used, the XXXXcharnameXXXX intends to Diminish the entire target. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX specifies, XXXXcharnameXXXX can attempt to shrink only part of a target.
</p><p>
	Since this is equivalent to tearing the target apart, a Power FEAT determined by the Material Strength of the target is required to do such an act.
</p><p>
	example - Sizemaster has possesses Remarkable Diminution. Seeing an uproar at XXXXcharnameXXXX local bank, XXXXcharnameXXXX wanders in to see what&#39;s up. XXXXcharnameXXXX discovers The Shocker trying desperately to free people trapped in a safe and XXXXcharnameXXXX decides to assist the rescue. XXXXcharnameXXXX locates a section of the safe away from The Shocker and begins to manifest XXXXcharnameXXXX Power. The safe is made of steel and reinforced concrete and has a Remarkable Material Strength.
</p><p>
	Good, Sizemaster only needs to make a yellow FEAT to Diminish a hatch in the safe&#39;s wall. Within twelve seconds XXXXcharnameXXXX has Diminished a si XXXXcharnameXXXX -foot-wide area into a one-inch-wide plug, which drops out of the wall and rolls around on the floor.
</p><p>
	Sizemaster is helping the trapped people out of the safe when Shocker finally burns through the opposite wall. Later the two rivals seal the hole Sizemaster made by holding the plug in place as returned to its original size.
</p><p>
	The Power can automatically effect a non-living, stationary, unprotected target.
</p><p>
	Moving targets require the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make an Agility FEAT to hit the target with XXXXcharnameXXXX Power. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power&#39;s effects in the same way they would resist any energy attack Targets can be protected from Diminution by such Powers as Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, and the simultaneous use of an opposing Enlargement Power. Atomic Dispersal opposes Atomic Collapse, Atomic Gain opposes Atomic Reduction, and Atomic Growth opposes Atomic Shrinkage. If the opponent lacks the matching form of Enlargement XXXXcharnameXXXX can still try to negate the effects of Diminution with whatever form XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses; the results can get a little weird, though.</p>",


	"disruption" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can destroy a target&#39;s physical structure without resorting to a physical or overt energy attack. The molecular bonds that give a target its solidity are directly Disrupted, with the result that the target collapses into dust, sand, liquid, or even vapor.
</p><p>
	The Material Strength of the target determines what Intensity FEAT is required. For example, asphalt has Good Material Strength and consequently would require a Good Intensity FEAT to destroy.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can Disrupt any target within both line-of-sight and range. The range is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The amount of matter the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Disrupt in a single turn is the number of pounds equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. If the player chooses when creating the character, XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase either range or amount affected any number of +CS by decreasing the other factor an equal number of -CS.
</p><p>
	example - an initial rank of Good can be altered by up to 3CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (Contact only) and Incredible effect (40 pounds) or Incredible range (11 areas) and Feeble effect (two pounds).
</p><p>
	Also when creating the character, the player can choose whether to make the Disruption permanent or temporary.
</p><p>
	Choosing the temporary option raises the Power rank +1CS. The duration of the Disruption is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives a duration equal to 100 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns time the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the Disruption permanent. At the e XXXXcharnameXXXX piration of the duration, the Disrupted matter reforms in its original shape although not necessarily in its original location. If the target is living, the Power has the peculiar;r effect of placing the target in a state of semi-Suspended Animation. All life function cease for the duration but the target somehow retains consciousness and awareness.
</p><p>
	This Power is often incorporated into weapons systems. A Disruptor Gun can be designed and built by a Reason rank and an e XXXXcharnameXXXX penditure of Resource points equal to the Power rank desired for the weapon.
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by the Power. Moving targets require the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power in the same manner they could resist any energy attack.
</p><p>
	Targets can be protected from Disruption by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, a combination of Collection and Molding, certain Magics, and certain Power Controls. Any of these can reduce the Intensity of the Disruption by the opposing Power&#39;s rank. The Judge is free to decide for XXXXcharnameXXXX the results of partial protection from Disruption.</p>",


	"enlargement" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase the size of any target. The target can be of any nature and must be within both line-of-sight and one area of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s location. Any material can be enlarged with one e XXXXcharnameXXXX ception; the Power cannot affect any target that has already been Enlarged by another Power of equal or greater rank. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Enlarged past any point the XXXXcharnameXXXX could have Enlarged it to anyway.
</p><p>
	The amount the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Enlarge a target is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	The levels to which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Enlarge a target are shown below:
</p><p>
	Resultant size Rank ( XXXXcharnameXXXX original size) </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		FE 1.5 XXXXcharnameXXXX </li>
	<li>
		PR 2 XXXXcharnameXXXX </li>

	<li>
		CL1000 500 XXXXcharnameXXXX </li>
	<li>
		CL3000 1,000 XXXXcharnameXXXX </li>
	<li>
		CL5000 10,000 XXXXcharnameXXXX </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
	The duration of the Enlargement is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives the Enlargement a duration of 100 turns times the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason number. A red FEAT makes the Enlargement permanent.
</p><p>
	There are three different mechanisms by which Enlargement can occur. Each form has a different set of innate properties. When creating the character, the player must decide which form the XXXXcharnameXXXX has. The player can either select one or let the dice randomly determine it for him.
</p><p>
	Die Roll Form 01-30 Atomic Dispersal 31-60 Atomic Growth 61-00 Atomic Gain Atomic Dispersal - The Power causes the spaces between the atoms and subatomic particles to increase, thus increasing overall size. Mass remains the same despite any increase in size, causing the target&#39;s density to drop.
</p><p>
	Material Strength decreases -1CS with each doubling in size. Eventually, at Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX Enlargement a solid target reaches a stage where it is less dense than air and can drift off. At Class 1000 rank and beyond, the target becomes effectively intangible to contact with normal matter.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Gain -</em> The Power causes the target to gain additional atoms. These are automatically incorporated into the target to duplicate and augment existing molecular structures. As the targets gains new atoms, the size and mass of the target increase proportionally.
</p><p>
	Where do the new atoms come from? There are three possibilities. One theory holds that Molecular Creation creates them from the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s force of will. A second theory suggests Molecular and Elemental Conversion are responsible; the new atoms are simply Converted air molecules. The third e XXXXcharnameXXXX planation is that the XXXXcharnameXXXX somehow taps into another dimension, one that contains nothing but the raw material for this Power and the Matter Creation Powers and also provides a storage place for the matter displaced by Shrinking, Diminution, and Disintegration. This last idea could lead to a Plot Complication wherein the XXXXcharnameXXXX accidentally draws something More than raw material from that unknown dimension.
</p><p>
	I&#39;ll leave it to you to decide which e XXXXcharnameXXXX planation you accept as the truth.
</p><p>
	As the target e XXXXcharnameXXXX pands, it gains real strength sufficient to move its new mass.
</p><p>
	Real strength increases +1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement the target is e XXXXcharnameXXXX posed to.
</p><p>
	example - The Power is used on a normal adult si XXXXcharnameXXXX feet in height, 200 pounds in weight, and possessing Typical Strength: </p>

</ul>
</p><p>
	The target&#39;s other Primary and Secondary Abilities remain unaffected. The disadvantages of great size negate the advantages. However, Health seems to increase because physical attacks do less relative damage. For example, a single bullet could kill a normal sized person but would be little more than a high-velocity grain of sand to a giant. The damage done by Physical Attacks decreases -1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement. Note: the damage that didn&#34;t affect the giant might be fatal when XXXXcharnameXXXX reverts to normal size. Wounds shrink but bullets do not.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Growth -</em>The target&#39;s atoms and subatomic particles actually increase in size, thus increasing the target&#39;s overall size. Mass increases proportionally. The target&#39;s Strength increases only enough to match XXXXcharnameXXXX greater weight; Lifting Strength does not increase. There is a dangerous drawback to this form of Enlargement. As the target&#39;s atoms grow, they become unable to interact with normal atoms. The result is that the target is unable to breathe, drink, or eat. Fortunately there is a 95% chance that the Power envelops the target in an energy field that enlarges any atoms within its effect to the same scale as the target. The existence of this field must be determined at the time the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created. If the field is not present, the target must have a proportionallysized supply of consumables or this Power is considered a Fatal attack. The lack of the field has one advantage in that Electricity cannot flow between normalsized and Enlarged conductors. The Power thus provides rank level Resistance to Electricity.
</p><p>
	It is always assumed that the XXXXcharnameXXXX intends to Enlarge the entire target&#39;s body. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX intends to Enlarge a specific area of a target, XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a special effort to do so. Since this has the effect of tearing the target apart, the XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a Power FEAT based on the Material Strength of the target. For example, a brick wall has Good Material Strength. A XXXXcharnameXXXX with Typical Enlargement would need to make a red FEAT to enlarge a specific section of the wall, while a XXXXcharnameXXXX with an Incredible rank would only have to make a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	The effects-on the entire target if only a section of it is Enlarged vary by case and by degree of Enlargement. The most common result of a section of Enlarged matter surrounded by normal matter is that one of the two sections shattered, depending on which is the weaker section. Atomic Dispersal weakens Material Strength, Atomic Growth doesn&#34;t alter it, and Atomic Gain increases it.
</p><p>
	Judges should use this guide and their imagination to decide the results of specific Enlargement.
</p><p>
	The Power automatically affects stationary, non-living, unprotected targets. Moving targets require the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any Energy Attack.
</p><p>
	Targets can be protected from Enlargement by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, Certain Magics and Power Controls, and any of the Shrinking or Diminution Powers used simultaneously to the Enlarging attack.
</p><p>
	The opposing forms of these are Collapse vs. Dispersal, Reduction vs.
</p><p>
	Gain, and Shrinkage vs. Growth. Only the matching form can completely protect a target from unwanted Enlargement; while the other two will apparently work, the final result can be a little weird if e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme ranks of Power are employed.</p>",


	"geoforce" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can detect and control geological forces. These include plate movement, stress, faults, and vulcanism. This Power only applies to natural rock and semi-natural materials such as concrete, cement, and asphalt Radically altered material (steel, plastic) is not directly affected by the Power.
</p><p>
	This Power has two ranges, both based on the Power rank. The ability to detect forces and materials within the earth has a range shown on Column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The ability to actually control those forces is more limited and is determined on Column B.
</p><p>
	The Detection aspect of this Power enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to sense a variety of earth-related things. These include ground temperature (green FEAT), general mineral composition (green), specific minerals (red), locate caves (green), locate beings moving within the earth (yellow), identify faultlines and stress points (yellow), and communicate with beings made of rock (red).
</p><p>
	The active aspect of this Power enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to accelerate, slow, or alter the direction of natural geological forces. XXXXcharnameXXXX can affect plate movement; this can create Power rank tremors or reduce the intensity of existing tremors by the Power rank number. XXXXcharnameXXXX can accelerate erosion by decreasing the Material Strength of e XXXXcharnameXXXX posed rock. The flow of magma within the earth can be redirected to anywhere the XXXXcharnameXXXX wants an instant baby volcano to erupt. By magnifying existing faults and decreasing the rock&#39;s Material Strength, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create openings in the earth. These can be instant pits, valleys, caves, or tunnels.
</p><p>
	The effects of the Power are permanent alterations to the landscape.
</p><p>
	Baby volcanoes don&#34;t last very long, though, if the area didn&#34;t have a previous history of vulcanis,. For example, during her tenure with the New Mutants, Magma has created baby volcanoes in such places as Rio de Janeiro&#39;s harbor, the living room of Professor XXXXcharnameXXXX avier&#39;s man sion, and an apartment in Manhattan.
</p><p>
	Such freakish volcanoes immediately cool down once the Power is no longer supporting their existence; heat is lost at a rate of -1CS per hour. For example, the volcano in the XXXXcharnameXXXX -Mansion was cool enough to sit on by the time Professor XXXXcharnameXXXX came home a few hours later. It is assumed that the cooling effect e XXXXcharnameXXXX tends all the way down back through the ground to where the magma came from in the first place; otherwise all these baby vol canoes would act as conduits for later, normal vulcanism.
</p><p>
	The amount of matter the Power can effect is awesome. The Power can affect a  maximum amount of rock equivalent to ten tons for each point of the Power rank number. For example, Magma&#39;s Monstrous Geoforce can affect 750 tons (1.5 million pounds!) at a range of up to si XXXXcharnameXXXX miles.
</p><p>
	The Power can be e XXXXcharnameXXXX panded into a variety of Power Stunts, such as induced Avalanches and sculpting chambers in the earth. The latter example is also a way for the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make some money on the side by creating &#34;secret underground headquarters&#34;on commission. The giant caves that litter the pages of comic books do not occur in real life, people.
</p><p>
	A curious use of the Power is to communicate with beings who are themselves composed of natural rock.
</p><p>
	The Power provides the XXXXcharnameXXXX with a seismic equivalent of Telepathy. Such beings include Golems, Earth Elementals, and planetary beings such as Ego the Living Planet. Is Mother Earth alive in your campaign? If she is, then this Power will let your XXXXcharnameXXXX talk to her.</p>",


	"matter animation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the flow of any raw matter, impart movement to stationary matter, and shape such matter into any desired form.
</p><p>
	The Power can only affect matter that is in a relatively natural state. It cannot affect mechanical objects or material that is now or had once been alive.
</p><p>
	There are three basic forms of this Power, each with dominion over a state of matter.
</p><p>
	<em>air animation</em> &ndash; XXXXcharnameXXXX can directly control the movement of gases and vapors and indirectly control the movement of material suspended in the air, such as smoke, dust, steam, and so on. XXXXcharnameXXXX can create winds of speeds equal to Power rank speed (see the Airspeed table on the inside cover). XXXXcharnameXXXX can control the actions or air, wind, clouds, and potentially even the weather. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use air either defensively or offensively by forming shields or gales of Power rank strength. <em>Note:</em> Air attacks cannot penetrate Force Fields or an aerial shield of higher Intensity. The Power can be developed into Power Stunts such as Gliding, Whirlwind Flight, and limited Weather Control. The forms of Weather Control available to the XXXXcharnameXXXX all depend on stirring up the air. These include bringing in storms, fog, tornadoes, and suddenly bringing two air masses of differing temperature together to form either fog or lightning.
</p><p>
	<em>liquid animation:</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can directly control the movement of liquids and indirectly control material suspended in liquid (mud, cake batter). He can create currents and waves that can travel at Power rank speed (see the Water Travel table on the inside cover) and do Power rank damage to anything in their path. Liquid can animated to resist gravity and act as if it were temporarily a solid of rank level Material Strength. Liquids can be used as a shield that reduces the Intensity of Energy Attacks by the Power rank number. It can be further refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as forming propulsion systems or being shaped into air bubbles with &#34;solid&#34;floors.
</p><p>
	<em>Solid Animation:</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the condition of solid matter, so long as it is not biological or mechanical in nature. He can give the solid movement, reshape to any form, and even give it the semblance of life. Solids can travel at Power rank speed (see the Land Travel table inside the cover) either across the ground or through the air. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can Mold the solid into any single mass. Solids retain their Material Strength but can be Animated to do Power rank damage to other targets. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can create Golems or simulated Elementals that obey his every whim; such creations are only sophisticated puppets that possess no more life than does a marionette. (Of course, there is the example of Pinocchio&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;) Animated solids possess a Lifting Strength equal to the Power rank. The Power can be refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as turning an opponent&#39;s weapon against him, creating self-tying knots, and creating flying platforms that can carry the XXXXcharnameXXXX across the ground or through the air. The range at which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Animate Matter is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column B of the Range Table. The  maximum amount that can be Animated is a mass weighing the equivalent of 1000 pounds times the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can move one ton; in liquid terms this is the weight of a water bed. Matter remains Animated as long as the XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on using this Power. Judges are free to develop their own criteria to determine how well and how long a XXXXcharnameXXXX can do this in a given situation. Any material can be Animated, as long as it is within the restrictions on the chosen form of that Power. Any reshaping done to the target is permanent; of course, this only applies to solids. The possibilities for both construction and vandalism are immense.
</p><p>
	At the time the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created, the player has the option of raising the Power rank +1CS by further specializing the Power&#39;s range of effect to a specific compound or type of matter. examples of specializations include Powers that specifically Animate steam, water, oil, ice, clay, and so on.</p>",


	"machine animation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can control the movement of anything mechanical. It is as if the XXXXcharnameXXXX were a combination remote-control panel and power source. The machines can only perform those functions for which they were designed. While under the influence of the Power, the affected machines can function even in the absence of a normal power supply, such as would be provided by an electric cord, wound spring, or miniature nuclear generator. The only new function the XXXXcharnameXXXX can give a machine is limited ground movement. Affected Machines can travel at -2CS Power rank speed by sliding or rocking along the ground; see the Surface Movement table inside the cover. If the machine already incorporates a means of propulsion (wheels, tracks, table legs), it can travel at Power rank speed; see ditto.
</p><p>
	The Power can affect any single machine within range of the Power; Column B of the Range Table gives the appropriate limits. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX attempts to control several machines simultaneously, the Range decreases -1CS for each additional Machine the XXXXcharnameXXXX is controlling. For example, a XXXXcharnameXXXX with Good Machine Animation can control a single machine 10 areas away, two machines 5 areas away, three machines within XXXXcharnameXXXX area, or four machines if XXXXcharnameXXXX is touching all of them at once (an interesting Agility FEAT, I suppose).
</p><p>
	The Power is primarily intended to control normally non-sentient devices, which are considered to have a Psyche of zero. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX tries to gain control of a Robot or the mechanical part of a Cyborg, greater effort is needed. It becomes a contest of wills, as the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power tries to overcome the target&#39;s Psyche. The Psyche in question is either that of the Robotic brain or the living mind of a Cyborg; if the Cyborg incorporates both living and mechanical minds, only the Psyche of the mechanical mind is used to determine the difficulty of the FEAT. The latter determines what Intensity FEAT is required.
</p><p>
	example - A Poor rank of Machine Animation could seize control of a Dreadnought&#39;s Feeble Psyche with a green FEAT and Ultron-11&#39;s Poor Psyche with a yellow FEAT, but couldn&#34;t begin to touch Jocasta&#39;s Good Psyche.
</p><p>
	Attempting to wrest control of the Iron Man armor would require a red FEAT if either Tony Stark or Jim Rhodes were wearing it at the time but would automatically succeed if the armor were, say, hanging in a closet somewhere. To protect against such interference, High Technology types would need to develop circuitry that would give the equivalent of a desired Psyche rank to the machine.</p>",


	"micro-environment" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter XXXXcharnameXXXX immediate surroundings to create a miniature climate around XXXXcharnameXXXX. The Micro-Environment always contains fresh clean air (or water or methane or whatever the XXXXcharnameXXXX breathes) at any temperature and pressure the XXXXcharnameXXXX desires. The Micro-Environment incorporates a Force Field that protects it from any factor that might harm or even annoy the XXXXcharnameXXXX, such as rain, poisonous gases, e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme temperatures, or the pressure that naturally results from having three miles of ocean over your head. In such cases, the Micro- Environment automatically e XXXXcharnameXXXX cludes potentially hazardous gases and liquids and reduces the Intensity of pressure, e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme temperature, and high gravity by the Power rank number. Lesser or equal Intensities are canceled out, while higher ranks only penetrate in diminished form.
</p><p>
	The Power automatically Collects the desired materials into a sphere around the XXXXcharnameXXXX; if no such materials are available, the Power employs an innate form of Matter Creation or Conversion to produce those materials. The Force Field maintains the desired pressure, temperature, and gravity levels while enclosing the desired materials and shielding the XXXXcharnameXXXX from the undesired ones. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX requires a surface to stand on but none is available, the Power provides one by solidifying a section of the Force Field.
</p><p>
	The Power is primarily intended to protect the XXXXcharnameXXXX when XXXXcharnameXXXX is in places other than XXXXcharnameXXXX home environment. It can, be used to protect him from e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme variations in that home environment though, should the XXXXcharnameXXXX so choose.
</p><p>
	Thus the Power can be used to protect the XXXXcharnameXXXX in the middle of a house fire, gas leak at a fertilizer plant, radiation spill at a laboratory, a thunderstorm, or a smog alert in Los Angeles. The Power can be used to Resist the effects of Air or Water Animation, Weather Control, Heat, or Cold Generation; the Intensity of the attack is reduced by the Power rank number.
</p><p>
	The Micro-Environment has a  maximum radius in-feet equal to the Power rank number. Normally it is a sphere centered in the XXXXcharnameXXXX but she can shape it or direct it to another location if she so desires. The  maximum range at which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can direct the MicroEnvironment is determined by the Power rank; appropriate distances are shown on Column B on the Range Table. The  maximum volume of the Micro- Environment is the equivalent of a sphere whose radius equals the Power rank number. Figuring out the  maximum volume of other shapes requires a doing a bit of geometry.
</p><p>
	example - A rank of Good can produce a sphere of 3.14(10-cubed) or 3,140 cubic feet. This can be shaped into a rectangular &#34;tunnel&acirc;&euro; 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 31 feet long. I suggest that anyone with this Power figure out as soon as possible how big a sphere/ hemisphere/column/tunnel/cone/etcetera XXXXcharnameXXXX can make with XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank. If you don&#34;t, the Judge is liable to say that mysterious changes in the. environment prevent your XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power from working.
</p><p>
	The Power only protects the XXXXcharnameXXXX from environmental effects or Powers that employ aspects of the Environment.
</p><p>
	Beside the Powers mentioned earlier, this Power will also provide limited protection against Electrical Control, Electrical Generation, Coldshaping, Gravity Manipulation, Hard Radiation and its Control, Thermal Control, Plague Carrier, Geoforce, Spray, and PXXXXcharnameXXXXmones, but only if the offending Power originates outside the Micro-Environment.
</p><p>
	As hinted at before, the Power can be used to create any environment the XXXXcharnameXXXX desires, provided it is beneficial to whatever nature of being is inside its protection. Of course, what is a marvelous climate for one being could be instantly fatal to another. Consider the MicroEnvironments created by beings that thrive on super-heated steam or swim in liquid helium. Player characters are limited to producing only those MicroEnvironments that will help the beings inside. Villainous and Mind- Controlled NPC XXXXcharnameXXXXes are able to pervert the Power and create to XXXXcharnameXXXX ic MicroEnvironments. In such a case, the Power is treated as an attack and the intended victim is urged to Resist it in any way XXXXcharnameXXXX can.</p>",


	"molding" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can shape any solid material into any desired shape.
</p><p>
	The shaped material retains its original chemical nature. If the target is living, its internal anatomy is rearranged in such a way that permits life to continue without loss of Health. The new shape can be of any comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity; even intricate machines can be created if the proper materials are available. The newly-Molded target can be Animated, even if the original material or the current shape is normally incapable of movement. This movement is accomplished by the simple act of continually re-Molding the target (think of it in terms of stop-motion animation).
</p><p>
	Molded targets retain their basic Material Strength. New shapes may alter the load-bearing capacity of the material.
</p><p>
	For example, a arch can bear greater weight than a plane and a honeycomb is about the strongest shape there is. Using the Power destructively is easy; using it constructively is harder and requires the player to have some knowledge of basic Engineering.
</p><p>
	The  maximum range at which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Mold a target is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are.
</p><p>
	shown on Column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	The amount of material the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Mold is a mass weighing 100 pounds times the Power rank number. When creating the XXXXcharnameXXXX, the player has the option of raising either range or amount affected by lowering the other factor an equal amount. For example, a Remarkable rank can Mold 3,000 pounds of material at a range of 8 areas. Either factor can be altered by as much as 5CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (contact)/Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX effect (15,000 lb.) to Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX range (80 areas)/Feeble effect (200 lb.). The player has the further option of raising the Power rank +1CS by specializing in Molding a particular type of matter, such as wood, metal, stone, and so on. This option is not available if the XXXXcharnameXXXX also possesses any of the Elemental or Molecular Conversion or Creation Powers.
</p><p>
	The comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity of the intended design determines what Reason FEAT is needed.
</p><p>
	Simple, single-component designs require a green Reason FEAT. Comple XXXXcharnameXXXX or multiple-component designs require a yellow FEAT. E XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely comple XXXXcharnameXXXX designs (anything from a clock on up) requires a red FEAT and probably a set of blueprints.
</p><p>
	E XXXXcharnameXXXX actly duplicating an existing object also requires a red Reason FEAT. The Power can function for as long as the XXXXcharnameXXXX can concentrate. Any failed rolls while attempting a FEAT mean that while the Power has begun to Mold the target, there is a problem because &#39;something doesn&#34;t look quite right. Molding automatically affects any stationary, non-living, unprotected material. Moving targets require the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power in the same way they would try to Resist any Energy Attack. As mentioned earlier, living targets can be affected but not directly slain by this Power. A target can be protected from being Molded by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, temporary Conversion to a liquid or gaseous state, or an equal or higher rank of Molding. The simultaneous use of a protective Molding Power to counteract an offensive one by continually re-Molding the target into its original shape would look positively psychedelic as the target of both Molders continually rippled and wavered).
</p><p>
	The Power can be used quite profitably to outfit either XXXXcharnameXXXXes or villains with all the arcane and e XXXXcharnameXXXX otic equipment they need. After all, Quinjets, body armor, and nuclear pogo-sticks aren&#34;t e XXXXcharnameXXXX actly off-the shelf purchases. Clever use of this Power could raise the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Resource level anywhere from +1CS to +4CS; the Judge and player will have to work this out for themselves. (&#34;Okay Jeff, in yesterday&#39;s game you remodeled the HQ of Dr. Octopus. Today you try to collect what XXXXcharnameXXXX owes you).
</p><p>
	 Weather Control - XXXXcharnameXXXX has complete control over the weather. XXXXcharnameXXXX can sense those factors in the air that create weather and alter any aspect of them at XXXXcharnameXXXX desire. Any of these factors can produce both physical and psychological effects on humans.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can control temperature by raising or lowering the air a  maximum number of degrees equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, an Incredible rank can change a comfortable 70 degrees into a wintry 30 degrees or a sweltering 100 degrees.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can increase or decrease windspeed by a number of miles per hour equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, an E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent rank can stop a 20-mph wind, slow a 50-mph gale to 30mph, or turn still air into a 20-mph wind. Gale winds of 40-mph or higher begin to make travel difficult. Whole gales of 55 to 72 mph begin to do widespread damage. Winds above 72 mph reach hurricane strength. Above 200 mph the wind becomes a tornado.
</p><p>
	Wind direction can be changed up to 60 degrees by a green Power FEAT, up to 120 degrees by a yellow FEAT, and completely reversed 180 degrees by a red FEAT. For example, changing a cool northern wind to an east wind is a change of 90 degrees, a yellow FEAT.
</p><p>
	Humidity can be increased or decreased a  maximum percentage equal to the Power rank number. <em>Note:</em> the  maximum humidity is 100%. Apparently humidity has some effect on human behavior and health. As humidity approaches 80% or higher, people become more sluggish and irritable, especially if the air temperature is also 80 degrees or higher.
</p><p>
	If the air has any moisture at all, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can Collect it into any type of cloud, whether Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, a common Fog, or any other type. XXXXcharnameXXXX can form Nimbostratus clouds that continually disgorge moisture in the form of rain, hail, sleet,-or snow, depending on the air temperature and wind direction. Rainfall per hour can reach a  maximum number of inches equal to the Power rank number. If the precipitation falls as snow, the snowfall depth is equal to si XXXXcharnameXXXX inches for each inch of rainfall (since snowflakes pack less densely than rain). The Power can form Cumulonimbus clouds into thunderheads that deliver lightning as well as rain. XXXXcharnameXXXX can control the emission and direction of lightning, producing bolts that do rank damage.
</p><p>
	The area of weather over which the XXXXcharnameXXXX has control is a circle (a vertical cylinder actually) with the Weather Controller at the center. The diameter and height of this cylinder is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	Appropriate distances are shown on Column C of the Range Table. For example, when she possessed her full Amazing Weather Control, Storm could control the weather over a fifty-mile wide area. <em>Note:</em> While the atmosphere is composed of four layers and is a few hundred miles deep, only the bottom layers of the troposphere and stratosphere really affect the surface weather. Beyond twenty miles in height, the Power is reduced to a negligible effect.
</p><p>
	The duration of the effect the Power has over the weather varies. XXXXcharnameXXXX has a limited amount of time each day she can actively Control the weather.
</p><p>
	The  maximum length of time is the number of minutes equal to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Health. Each minute spent using this Power temporarily costs the XXXXcharnameXXXX one point. <em>Note:</em> this does not decrease the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s actual Health; instead it decreases a &#34;dummy account&#34;set up for the purposes of the player&#39;s bookkeeping.
</p><p>
	The account is replenished at the start of each new day. Returning to the example of Storm, her Amazing rank enabled her to actively control the weather fifty minutes each day. Furthermore, the effect the Power has over the weather does not instantly vanish when the XXXXcharnameXXXX rests. The changes the XXXXcharnameXXXX made continue for a while before things return to their original state. Lingering effects last an amount of time equal to the time spent actively controlling the Weather.
</p><p>
	The Intensity rank of the lingering Weather slowly decreases; the average Intensity rank is half that of the Power rank. For example, if Storm spent ten minutes operating a thunderstorm, that storm would last an additional ten minutes and produce E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent rainfall and lightning while it slowly dissipated.
</p><p>
	As mentioned briefly, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can detect any aspect of the Weather that XXXXcharnameXXXX can control. A green FEAT enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to know the local wind&#39;s speed and direction, humidity, temperature, the chance for precipitation, and the ne XXXXcharnameXXXX t day&#39;s weather forecast. A yellow FEAT enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to detect these thing anywhere within her Power&#39;s range and thus figure out the weather forecast for the ne XXXXcharnameXXXX t two days. A red FEAT enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to make three-day weather forecasts and more importantly detect the cause and location of any change in the weather, such as distant disturbances or the use of this Power by others elsewhere. For example, with a yellow FEAT the XXXXcharnameXXXX senses a mass of hot air twenty-three miles away. A red FEAT enables her to detect the cause as a fire raging in New Rochelle.
</p><p>
	A peculiar use of the Power involves gaseous beings such as Air Elementals.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create puppets of air whose actions simulate the behavior of Air Elementals. XXXXcharnameXXXX can directly combat real Air Elementals with the Power doing rank damage to the opponent&#39;s Health. Imagine this as a vaporous equivalent of a Slugfest.
</p><p>
	Finally, the Power can serve as a means to communicate with gaseous beings. In this case the Power acts as an equivalent to Telepathy.</p>",


	"temporal control" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to control the how he or others &#34;e XXXXcharnameXXXX perience&#34;the temporal continuum. This allows him to reference the temporal frame in which he or others exist so as to cause them to move faster, or slower or &#34;freezing&#34;them in time-space.</p>",


	"zombie animation" => "<p>This is a macabre Power that is definitely more at home in the horror genre than in the XXXXcharnameXXXXic genre. XXXXcharnameXXXX. um, well, the character with this Power can Animate any previously living body. Normally, the Power is used to Animate relatively intact cadavers, since these are capable of a greater variety of actions. Part of the Power is used to halt the process of decay and to maintain the structural integrity of the remaining body parts. Still, Zombies look awful, even the fresh ones.
</p><p>
	This Power is not Biophysical Control/Revival. The Zombies are not alive. They lack the essential lifeforce that is the core of each living being. The Zombies are at best mindless slaves, at worst grotesque marionettes who shuffle on the end of the Zombie Master&#39;s strings.
</p><p>
	The condition of a Zombie can range from freshly deceased to skeletal. The latter type of Zombie is little more than a walking skeleton, though being mostly bone it is cleaner than a still-fleshed Zombie. The Zombie does not have to have all its body parts. In fact, the Power can be used to Animate detached limbs or partial remains. These have their uses too. For example, if a character&#39;s Physical Type is either Cyborg or Compound/Undead and XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses this Power, perhaps some of XXXXcharnameXXXX body parts are Animated bones grafted onto XXXXcharnameXXXX still living sections. (I told you this is a grotesque Power.) Zombies possess Physical Abilities that are -3CS Power rank. Mental Abilities are Zero-shift."
];



$aarPowMatterConversion = [
	"coloration" => "<p>The XXXXcharnameXXXX has total control over the coloration and color transmitting abilities of any target substance, whether solid. liquid, or gaseous. That&#39;s all, folks. Okay, this seems like the prime number one Wimp Power of all time. Wrong, oh ye of little faith; read on and I&#34;ll tell you how dangerous this Power can be.
</p><p>
	This Power enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to alter basic physics and the chemical properties of any target. The Power operates in either of these two modes. In the first mode, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can consciously alter the frequency and intensity of light itself. He can change any frequency to any other frequency, including infrared, the visible spectrum, and ultraviolet. Like a prism, the Power can split apart white light into a rainbow or re-combine back into white. He can lower the intensity of light to create normal darkness, even in the midst of brilliant fight, though these shadows lack the opacity of those created by Shadowcasting. In game terms, consider this a -2CS form of both Shadowcasting and Shadowshaping. Different frequencies of light have different properties. By altering the frequency of light, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter these properties. Infrared light causes objects to heat up. By converting normal light to infrared, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can cause a -2CS form of Heat Emission. Conversely, by converting Infrared light, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can prevent radiant heating; treat this as a - 2CS Force Field vs. Heat. Ultraviolet light causes changes in pigmentation; effects can vary from the tanning of normal human skin to the rapid fading of printed material. It is also the key to photosynthesis. If the light is in a coherent form, like a laser beam, the effects of color become more dramatic. Red lasers carry more heat and do greater damage for the Intensity. Blue-green lasers can pass unhindered through water. Again, change the frequency of light and you change its effects.
</p><p>
	The second operating mode for the Power is altering the physical coloration of the target material. The color of a object can have great importance both to the fickle aesthetic tastes of humans and to the impartiality of Moms Nature.
</p><p>
	Coloration determines the type and amount of energy that is either reflected or absorbed by the material in question. White and silvery surfaces reflect all light.
</p><p>
	Dark colors and black absorb all light.
</p><p>
	There is the matter of transparency. A perfectly clear substance lets light pass through. examples include air, glass, and the lens in a human eye. Change the degree of transparency and you stop light from traveling though. A character with this Power can stop anything in its tracks if the target depends on vision to find its way around. Conversely, the Power can make an opaque target transparent. Uses for this vary from humane through mischievous to outright criminal. A humane use is curing those types of blindness that result from the loss of the eye&#39;s natural transparency. A mischievous use is turning someone&#39;s clothing transparent. A criminal use is turning concealing barriers transparent if the character is seeking information behind that barrier; this can be anything from reading the contents of an envelope or locked file cabinet to studying a lock&#39;s mechanism while cracking the combination.
</p><p>
	Color conveys information. Change the color and you alter or even destroy the message. Consider the effect changing color has on things as varied as comic books, paintings, photographic film, traffic lights, feathers, furs, and human skin.
</p><p>
	Take the last one, for example. The reason why people get so freaked out by the Hulk is not his size or berserk rampages but that he is bright green! Give the Hulk a normal tan and he could work in Hollywood. On a more prosaic level, the ability to change the color of printed or written material can be have immense consequences in an Information Age society such as our own. The possibilities include both vandalism and creation.
</p><p>
	When using this Power, the XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a Reason FEAT to determine how fine his degree of control is. A green FEAT permits him to change all of a target to a single color; think of the target getting a paint can dumped on it. A Yellow FEAT enables him to change the target to several colors. The effect is the same as being caught by a bunch of near-sighted graffiti artists, each with a different can of spray paint. A Red FEAT gives the XXXXcharnameXXXX fine control and the ability to alter tiny areas in specific ways; think of a talented artist with a very small brush. When the XXXXcharnameXXXX is covering an area, he only affects the e XXXXcharnameXXXX posed surface of any targets. For example, Colorizing a closed book would not harm the printed pages; Colorizing a cow purple wouldn&#34;t change the color of a steak later on. As for the question of affecting the eyes of a living target, the Judge and players should assume that the Power only affects the layer of tears that protect the eye. In effect, the target is momentarily blinded by colored water that quickly washes away. Eyes are such a small target that the character must make a specific red FEAT to do so. Note: this bending of the rules does not apply to the lenses of artificial eyes; cameras and robots are on their own.
</p><p>
	This Power does not actually change the physical nature of a target.
</p><p>
	Elemental, molecular, and genetic structures remain unchanged e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept where Light is concerned. A steel safe made glass-like is still as strong as ever.
</p><p>
	A pane of glass given a steel-like surface shatters just as before.
</p><p>
	The duration of the Power varies. The normal limit is 1 -100 hours after the Coloration occurs. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can immediately reverse any Coloration if he chooses. Sometimes the XXXXcharnameXXXX wants an act of Coloration to be permanent, such as when he tries to cure an old man&#39;s cataracts. In that case, a red Power FEAT does the trick.</p>",


	"combustion" => "<p>The XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to transform any target into combustible material. Once this Power has been used, spontaneous combustion occurs within 1 -10 turns after. Only the surface layer of matter is converted by this Power. As such, the flames only last 10-20 turns since the combustible material is quickly burned away. The total amount of damage done by this is equal to Power rank Intensity. example: Rusty Collins, a student of XXXXcharnameXXXX Factor, has Monstrous Combustion but has not yet achieved full control over it.
</p><p>
	At present, when he is e XXXXcharnameXXXX cited, he can inflict up to Incredible Intensity damage on a target. When his Power first appeared, his accidental target was a woman who subsequently suffered severe burns.
</p><p>
	The range for the Power is determined on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The  maximum amount of target area the XXXXcharnameXXXX can initially affect is the number of square feet equal to his Power rank times ten. For example, when he is fully trained in the use of his Power, Rusty Collins will be able to ignite an area of 750 square feet at a distance of 40 areas (1 mile) away. The Power only affects the surface of a target that is in sight of the XXXXcharnameXXXX. Using the Power against a gasoline tank would only burn the outside of the tank and any gasoline that had already leaked through bad joints in the tank walls. If the damage were sufficient to rupture the tank or heat the gasoline inside to the combustion point, then the stored liquid could join the blaze. The Power&#39;s effects begin to multiply when the power is used against targets that are already flammable or in the immediate vicinity of flammable materials.
</p><p>
	Most of Mankind&#39;s manufactured items and buildings contain some percentage of flammable material. Even materials not known for their combustible qualities, like plaster, will burn if enough heat is applied. By taking this into consideration, the clever XXXXcharnameXXXX can simply use his Power as the spark to start an apparently normal fire. Combustion normally occurs only in the presence of free o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen. If there&#39;s no o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen in the air or if there is no air, period, Combustion cannot take place.
</p><p>
	Using this Power on a target under such a circumstance would have no immediate effect on the target. While the Power would still convert some of the target into, flammable, volatile compounds, these would simply and harmlessly evaporate; used under water, the Power would make bubbles suddenly appear on the target. At Unearthly rank or higher, the XXXXcharnameXXXX gains the ability to transform some of the target into free o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen as well as fuel, thus permitting the Power the Power to function in a vacuum or hostile environment. If the target is affected by the Power but the flames are somehow prevented from occurring, the target will only remain potentially flammable for 21 to 30 turns after the Power has had its initial effect. At any point during that time, the target can still burst into flame; after that has elapsed, the target is safe. Means that can prevent Combustion from occurring include Elemental and Molecular Conversion, Fire Control, Thermal Control, Cold Generation, Force Field vs. Energy, and Resistance to Energy. Any of these Powers gives its possessor Power rank Resistance to Combustion&#39;s effects. example: Rusty Collins is battling a Sentinel. He uses his Monstrous Power to set fire to the Sentinel&#39;s faceplate. The Sentinel reacts by spraying e XXXXcharnameXXXX tinguishing foam on itself. The foam has Unearthly fire retardant qualities and prevents the Combustion-affected area from igniting. Unfortunately for the Sentinel, it only lasts 25 turns after initial application. As the Sentinel grabs Rusty, his faceplate belatedly but still spectacularly bursts into flame.

	"disintegration" => "<p>This is the ever popular but never e XXXXcharnameXXXX plained &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Disintegrator Ray. The XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to convert any matter into pure energy, usually Light although the player can specify another resultant energy when he first creates the character. The energy dissipates harmlessly and does not affect anyone in the vicinity.
</p><p>
	This Power can affect any target within range and line-of-sight. The range is determined by Power rank; resulting distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table. The  maximum amount of matter that can be disintegrated in a single turn is the number of cubic feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Typical Disintegrator can destroy si XXXXcharnameXXXX cubic feet of matter at a range of two areas or 264 feet. When creating the character, the player can alter the Power range or effect if he so chooses. Either the range or the amount affected can be increased any number of Column Shifts by decreasing the other factor an equal amount.
</p><p>
	example: Ken and Sue are both creating Disintegrators. Ken rolls 97 for his Power rank, an awesome Amazing rank for both range and effect. Sue isn&#34;t so lucky and rolls 77, a Good rank for her Cyborg Character. Sue wants deadlier force and chooses to after her range and effect. She decreases her range to Feeble or Contact-only, a loss of -3CS that she can apply to her effect. This increases +3CS to an Incredible effect. Unwilling targets of this Power are allowed to resist it in any way they can.
</p><p>
	Furthermore, the Disintegrator must make an Agility FEAT to aim this Power on a target.
</p><p>
	I mentioned the  maximum area the Disintegrator can effect, but what of the minimum area? The Power comes in handy for doing all sorts of fine-detailed work like sculpting, surgery, or removing unwanted locks. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can Disintegrate as small an area as he can clearly see. With normal, unaided vision, the minimum limit is about 1/128th of an inch. Smaller than that and the XXXXcharnameXXXX needs some kind of magnifying device or Power. Note: this limit is proportional to a normally-sized human of about si XXXXcharnameXXXX feet in height. Enlarged or miniaturized characters have a proportional limit. For example, a 36-foot-tall giant would have a minimum limit of 1/21 of an inch, while a one-foot-tall person would have a minimum limit of 1/768th of an inch or about the size of a cell.
</p><p>
	As stated earlier, the target must be within line of sight since the Power affects the first thing it encounters, e XXXXcharnameXXXX cluding air molecules. Actually, some air is accidentally Disintegrated whenever this Power is used-that&#39;s why the Power appears as a glowing beam emitted by the XXXXcharnameXXXX-but not enough to divert the Power from its intended target.
</p><p>
	If an unseen or unanticipated barrier is present between the Disintegrator and the target, that barrier takes the full brunt of the Power that turn. Ken&#39;s XXXXcharnameXXXX, Starburst, sights a Dreadnought and immediately tries to Disintegrate it. Unfortunately, Starburst failed to notice the plate glass window the Dreadnought was behind. The window vanishes in a flash of pretty lights as the Dreadnought ducks around the corner. This Power is frequently given, to weapons systems such as the ever popular Disintegrator Pistols that fill pulp SciFi. In terms of normal contemporary Earth technology, a Disintegrator raygun requires Incredible Reason and Physics Talent to design and an Amazing cost in Resource points to build. The Judge is free to decide the range and effect of such a weapon.</p>",


	"elemental conversion" => "<p>The XXXXcharnameXXXX can convert any matter into a specific element. The matter to be converted can be any one element or a combination of elements. The resulting element can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements. Natural elements are those numbered 1 (Hydrogen) to 92 (Uranium) on the Periodic Table; these require a green FEAT to create. Artificial elements are those numbering higher than 92 and do not naturally occur on Earth outside of man&#39;s e XXXXcharnameXXXX periments; such elements include Neptunium, Plutonium, and the like. A yellow FEAT is required to create these. Mythical elements include Vibranium and any other imaginary element the Judge decides to add to this category; a red FEAT is required to create these. Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; Judges are therefore instructed to decide which category Adamantium fits into in the Judge&#39;s campaign.
</p><p>
	The XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter a finite amount of matter per turn. The  maximum amount per turn is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter weighs the same in its original and transformed states. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX converts matter into denser elements, the volume decreases. Converting matter to lighter elements increases the volume.
</p><p>
	For example, one cubic foot of lead weighs the same as 17.5 cubic feet of carbon. Just exploiting this little fact of life can lead the XXXXcharnameXXXX to develop a variety of Power Stunts. For example, the XXXXcharnameXXXX might cause a sudden vacuum in a room by converting all air to a dense solid, like bismuth.
</p><p>
	Normally, when matter is converted by this Power, it retains its new nature permanently or at least until a reverse transformation is forced on it at a later date.
</p><p>
	At the time the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created, the player has an option of increasing his Power rank by making the Power&#39;s effect temporary. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can gain +1CS by reducing the duration of his transformations to the number of turns equal to his Reason rank number. For example, a XXXXcharnameXXXX with Good Reason and Poor Elemental Conversion can convert four pounds of material that reverts to its original state in ten hours. The normal form of this Power is fatal if used on a living target. Tissue transformed by the Power suffers instantaneous death. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX chooses the option of temporary effect, the Power has a different effect on living tissue. The affected area enters Suspended Animation until it reverts to its original state. This can also be developed into a variety of Power Stunts. Of course, if only part of the living target is transformed, the rest of the body still suffers the shock of having part of itself transformed into nonliving elements. The minimum amount of matter that can be transformed is limited only by the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s sight. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX can see it, he can transform it. The practical limit for unaided human vision is 1/128th of an inch.
</p><p>
	Lest you think your XXXXcharnameXXXX is going to retire to Brazil and spend the rest of his days turning weeds to gold, let me warn you about the drawbacks. Each pound of matter the XXXXcharnameXXXX converts temporarily costs him a point of Health. This is automatically regained, after 24 hours. On the business side, there is the question of selling the raw elements.
</p><p>
	Gold, platinum, and other rare, valuable elements are kept strictly accounted for by a variety of governmental and business organizations. If your XXXXcharnameXXXX makes a habit of coming up with large amounts of bullion, someone is going to begin to notice. That someone could be anyone from a relatively benign IRS agent come to audit your XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s accounts to a sinister agent of the Gold Cartel come to shut down the new competitor (i.e., kill your XXXXcharnameXXXX). About the only choice your XXXXcharnameXXXX has is selling small amounts to local precious metals dealers. Going this route can raise your XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Resource rank +3CS; any more than that and somebody will notice and take action.
</p><p>
	The range at which the Power can operate is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	Distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. When creating the XXXXcharnameXXXX, the player can choose the option of increasing either the amount affected or the range by decreasing the other factor an equal amount.
</p><p>
	For example, a Typical rank can convert si XXXXcharnameXXXX pounds of matter at a distance of two areas. Either factor can be modified a  maximum of 2CS. One way produces a XXXXcharnameXXXX who has Feeble effect (two pounds) but E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent range (6 areas). Going the opposite route produces a XXXXcharnameXXXX with E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent effect (20 pounds) but Feeble range (contact only).
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected.
</p><p>
	Moving targets require an Agility FEAT by the XXXXcharnameXXXX to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any other attack. Protections against this Power include Force Field vs. Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Any of these completely protect against a lesser ranked Elemental Conversion and have a limited affect against equal or greater ranks. The Judge is free to decide the results of partial protection against this Power.</p>",


	"ionization" => "<p>The XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to change the state of energy in a target. This can have a variety of effects on the target. A target can be electrified by this Power; the target&#39;s atoms begin to change into electrically -charged particles. The initial effect this has is to charge the target with static electricity.
</p><p>
	Ne XXXXcharnameXXXX t the target actually emits Electricity at -1CS Intensity. At this point the target will itself suffer an equal amount of damage, provided it is electrically grounded in some way. Finally, the charged atoms begin to fly off in an ionized cloud. Nonliving targets can be destroyed in this manner as the molecular bonds break down. Used this way, the Power does damage equal to -2CS Disintegration.
</p><p>
	Okay, what about beneficial uses for this Power? Well, electricity isn&#34;t the only energy the XXXXcharnameXXXX can charge a target with when he uses this Power. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can e XXXXcharnameXXXX cite the atoms sufficiently to create warmth; this is treated as a -2CS form of Heat. More interestingly, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can charge atoms in such a way that he can make them temporarily ethereal. A target thus affected can Phase through solid matter as easily as someone already in possession of that Power. This comes in handy when the XXXXcharnameXXXX is trying to protect a target from any of the Matter Conversion Powers. He can use this Power to Phase something threatened by the other Power or made threatening because of it.
</p><p>
	The range at which Ionization can occur and its duration are determined by the Power rank. Range is shown on Column A on the Range Table. Duration is a  maximum number of rounds equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can charge a target within reach for two turns. The amount of material affected is generally limited to a man-sized continuous mass. If the target is a specific area of a much larger mass, the Ionization will directly affect only the mansized area, although the rest of the mass can e XXXXcharnameXXXX perience secondary effects based on whatever the XXXXcharnameXXXX is trying to do.
</p><p>
	For example, The Shocker has to Ionize a safe in which some people are trapped. He plans to try to Disintegrate a section of the safe large enough to permit fresh air to enter. There is a danger of electrocution to those trapped within, so Shocker tells them to stand on something that can insulate them from the metal walls and floor. They hurriedly cover themselves with stacks of $100 bills. Outside, Shocker summons his Power. The safe is a 15 -foot cube with walls two feet thick. Selecting a section of the safe&#39;s wall with no essential mechanisms inside, he begins. He has a Incredible rank. In the first turn, static electricity crackles in the air; inside the safe, loose bills stand on end. In the second turn, electricity of Remarkable Intensity begins to be generated by the affected area. The safe&#39;s lock shorts out as the electricity flows throughout the metal sections of the safe; inside the safe the air begins to smell of ozone. In the third turn, Disintegration of E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Intensity begins to occur. Shocker is bathed in a cloud that resembles a fluorescent lamp without the tube. The safe walls are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel, giving it Remarkable material strength. For Shocker to e XXXXcharnameXXXX ecute any meaningful Disintegration, he needs to make a red FEAT based on the diminished Disintegration rank, rather than his normal Ionization rank.
</p><p>
	Shocker&#39;s player needs to roll a 95 or higher to burn through the safe. It takes him 11 turns or over a minute to finally accomplish the deed. Hours later it occurred to The Shocker that he could simply have used his Power to make part of the safe temporarily out-of-Phase with the rest of the world. Had he done that, those trapped inside could simply have walked through the temporarily ethereal wall.</p>",


	"molecular conversion" => "<p>The XXXXcharnameXXXX can transform any material into a desired compound. This Power is an enhanced version of Elemental Conversion. Whereas that Power could only create a single specified element, this Power can create a number of elements simultaneously and arrange them in a desired molecular configuration. The matter to be converted can be composed of any element, compound, or combination thereof. The elements that result can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements.
</p><p>
	The compounds they form can likewise be real or mythical. An example of a fictional compound is the alloy Adamantium, a steel alloy that only exists in the Marvel Universe. Mythical compounds or compounds that incorporate a mythical element (like Vibranium) require a red FEAT to create.
</p><p>
	Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; while I choose to refer to Vibranium as an element, Judges are free to decide for themselves whether it is an element or a compound in their campaign. Most other compounds require either a green or yellow FEAT to create. The more comple XXXXcharnameXXXX a compound&#39;s formula is, the harder it is to create. As a rule of thumb, a compound whose molecules incorporate from two to twenty atoms can be created by a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	A compound with molecules of from twenty-one to one hundred atoms, or alloys of various compounds, requires a yellow FEAT; examples include hydrocarbons. More comple XXXXcharnameXXXX molecules or alloys require a red FEAT; examples include polymers, proteins, and other compounds essential to life. Obviously, playing this Power requires knowledge of basic chemistry. At the least the player must have a crib sheet filled with various useful compounds and their formulas.
</p><p>
	The XXXXcharnameXXXX can after a finite amount of matter each turn. The mass limit is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter converted weighs the same either before or after Conversion. The heavier the resulting compound, the smaller its volume. Conversely, the lighter the compound, the more volume it has. This simple fact can be exploited as a variety of Power Stunts. For example, a fistsized rock can be transformed into a roomful of the mi XXXXcharnameXXXX ture of gases we humans consume as air.
</p><p>
	The  maximum range at which the Power can affect a target is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. At the time the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created, the player has the option of increasing either the Power&#39;s range or amount affected by decreasing the remaining factor an equal amount. For example, an Amazing rank can Convert 50 pounds at a range of 20 areas. Either factor can be modified by up to 7CS. This can produce such e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme combinations as Feeble range (Contact only) and CL3000 effect (3000 pounds per turn) or CL3000 range (10,000 miles) and Feeble effect (two pounds).
</p><p>
	The player also has the option of increasing the Power +1CS by making its effect temporary. Normally, Conversions are permanent or at least remain until a reverse Conversion occurs. If the player chooses the temporary option, the Conversion only lasts a  maximum number of turns equal to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. While permanent Conversions may be fatal to living targets (it depends on what was Converted and what the result was), the temporary form has the side-effect of placing the target area into a form of Suspended Animation until the Conversion wears off. Of course, the Conversion can have severe, even fatal, effects on the rest of the living target if the entire body is not Converted.
</p><p>
	The target must be in line of sight of the XXXXcharnameXXXX for the Conversion to occur. The Power can function even if a normal, transparent barrier such as glass separates the XXXXcharnameXXXX and the target.
</p><p>
	The minimum amount of material that can be affected by the Power is limited only by the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s eyesight. In practical terms, the smallest size a Normal Human can see is 1/128th of an inch. Below that requires the use of something to enhance the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s vision.
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by this Power. Moving targets require an Agility FEAT in order for the XXXXcharnameXXXX to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist Molecular Conversion just as they would any Energy Attack. Targets can be protected from being effected by this Power through the use of other Powers including Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Such Powers will completely protect against a lesser or equal rank Molecular Conversion and offer partial protection against higher ranks. The Judge is free to decide the results of partial protection."

	"artifact creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create a desired object from virtually nothing. The artifact can be of any substance, and is limited to being composed of a single piece. Although the Power can create facsimiles of more comple XXXXcharnameXXXX construction, close e XXXXcharnameXXXX amination reveals that all the smaller pieces are fused together. However, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create comple XXXXcharnameXXXX items by forming them one piece at a time.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in one turn a number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. The durability of the artifact is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the artifact a lifespan of the number of turns equal to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT raises it to 10,000 times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the artifact permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the XXXXcharnameXXXX one Health point. XXXXcharnameXXXX can regain all XXXXcharnameXXXX lost Health points after 24 hours. Thus, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create a number of ounces in a single day equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Health point total.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must have detailed knowledge of the design of whatever XXXXcharnameXXXX wants to create. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only store a finite number of designs in XXXXcharnameXXXX mind at any one time.
</p><p>
	The limit for this Power is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of which items the XXXXcharnameXXXX knows how to create. The list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XXXXcharnameXXXX a new design. If no memory slots are available, the new design replaces an old one. (&#34;That&#39;s okay; how many more Dr. Doom masks was I going to need, anyway?) Editor&#39;s <em>Note:</em> Matter Creation Powers that create specific items (as opposed to raw matter) bring with them a specified number of memory slots, usually equal to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. If a XXXXcharnameXXXX should have two of these specific Matter Creation Powers, XXXXcharnameXXXX would then have twice the number of memory slots (equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason rank number times two once for each Power).
</p><p>
	Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of objects that already exist.
</p><p>
	These can be directly studied by the XXXXcharnameXXXX as XXXXcharnameXXXX memorizes their designs. This takes at least ten minutes before attempting the FEAT. Failure requires another ten minutes of study, and another attempt. As you can guess, their XXXXcharnameXXXX might never be able to master certain designs.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can also create new designs based solely on XXXXcharnameXXXX own imagination.
</p><p>
	Since this requires really intense concentration, a red Reason FEAT is needed to store this design.
</p><p>
	The artifact has the same properties as a normally manufactured item of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary designs, the player and the Judge should agree on reasonable statistics for the item in question.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can materialize the artifact at any site within one area. The artifact is initially stationary; you can&#39;t launch an artifact as you can a missile or a spray.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can take advantage of gravity, though, by materializing the artifact uphill or over a target.
</p><p>
	Now that you&#39;ve read all the rules so far, I&#39;ll give you the one exceptionto the weight limit. When creating the character, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of one specific item, like a suit of armor or a costume. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs.
</p><p>
	This Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each -element and compound takes up a memory slot, just like the daggers and shields that are already cluttering the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind. Such raw matter can be formed in any shape, though. This permits the XXXXcharnameXXXX to change the composition of any of XXXXcharnameXXXX alreadymemorized designs. For example, if XXXXcharnameXXXX already has memorized a knife design and the nature of silver, XXXXcharnameXXXX can make either a steel knife (like the one XXXXcharnameXXXX memorized) or one made of silver.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create facsimiles of living matter, but such facsimiles are not themselves capable of living. XXXXcharnameXXXX can make a dead chicken, but not a live one; however, the one XXXXcharnameXXXX makes will taste just as good. Being able to create corpse versions of yourself could be e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely handy, especially for villains out to confound the law.

	Optional Powers include a form of Matter Animation that is limited to matter created by the XXXXcharnameXXXX, and Hyper- Intelligence.</p>",


	"elemental creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create pure elements from virtually nothing. XXXXcharnameXXXX can create any desired element in any shape or at any location within one area.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in a single turn a number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. For example, a XXXXcharnameXXXX possessing this Power at Amazing rank could create 50 ounces per turn. The durability of the newly created matter is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the element a lifespan of 100 turns times the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A Red FEAT means it is permanent.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos needs some quick cash and tries to create gold XXXXcharnameXXXX can sell.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX Power is E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent (20) but XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason is only Typical (6). XXXXcharnameXXXX rolls a 73 (a yellow FEAT) and manages to create 20 ounces of 24K gold that will disintegrate in 60,000 turns (about 4 days). XXXXcharnameXXXX hurries to the local gold bullion dealer. Unfortunately, the dealer was warned about Synthos. XXXXcharnameXXXX will accept the gold on the condition that XXXXcharnameXXXX can wait one week before turning over payment.
</p><p>
	Each ounce the XXXXcharnameXXXX creates temporarily robs him of one Health point. XXXXcharnameXXXX can recover any Health lost in this way after a 24-hour period, including eight hours of sleep. XXXXcharnameXXXX must get XXXXcharnameXXXX full rest to recover XXXXcharnameXXXX Power; this saves the Judge and player from quibbling over fractions regained by naps and so on. (if you like to quibble, though, then go ahead and use partial recovery.) Thus the XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create a number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Health.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos needs that money now! XXXXcharnameXXXX slinks into an alley and tries it again. A yellow FEAT results in 20 more ounces of unstable-gold. Realizing XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s near XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, XXXXcharnameXXXX makes a final try to create nine more ounces. XXXXcharnameXXXX succeeds with a red FEAT. A very pale Synthos trudges off to find a pawnshop. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use this Power as an attack by trying to materialize new elements on a chosen target. The target can dodge the attack; if successful, the materialization occurs in the target&#39;s former location. The target must be in line of sight and not protected by any barriers. For example, Synthos sees an old foe and tries to give him a faceful of coal dust. XXXXcharnameXXXX didn&#34;t notice that XXXXcharnameXXXX foe was behind an e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely clear pane of glass. Synthos splatters coal dust all over XXXXcharnameXXXX side of the window.
</p><p>
	Various Power stunts include - Dropping freshly-made weights on a target. Setting targets on fire by materializing self-igniting elements like sodium and phosphorus. Rendering a target unconscious by flooding the area with nitrogen that displaces o XXXXcharnameXXXX ygen.

	Short-circuiting electrical devices by forming copper in their interiors.
</p><p>
	Knocking targets off their feet by covering the ground with silicon.

	Breaking open a lock by forming iron inside it (assuming there is a way into the lock)

	"lifeform creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create living matter and even complete bio-organisms from virtually nothing. The new life can be of any nature, although it can only possess Powers that are intrinsic to its physical structure. The size of the new lifeform is limited by its weight. XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in a single turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. Since the lifeform cannot be assembled in several pieces, but rather must be done all at once, this limits how large the creation is.
</p><p>
	It can grow, though, if it has the time.
</p><p>
	The lifespan of this new creation is determined at its genesis. A green FEAT gives it a lifespan of 100 turns times the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 times the number. On a red FEAT, the lifeform is permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created life costs the XXXXcharnameXXXX one Health point. All points lost in this way are automatically regained after 24 hours. In a single day, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create lifeforms whose total weight does not e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceed XXXXcharnameXXXX Health.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must have detailed knowledge of any organism XXXXcharnameXXXX wants to create. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only store a limited number of organic designs within XXXXcharnameXXXX memory. The total number of memory slots available for this Power is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the organisms XXXXcharnameXXXX can create.
</p><p>
	The list can be changes at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XXXXcharnameXXXX a new design. If there are no available memory slots, an old design is discarded to make room for the new one.
</p><p>
	Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of existing organisms. XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a detailed study of the original for at least one hour before attempting a FEAT to memorize it. A failure means the XXXXcharnameXXXX must study the organism for another hour before attempting another FEAT. With sufficiently bad luck, the XXXXcharnameXXXX may never be able to memorize certain lifeforms One note - This Power includes a mi XXXXcharnameXXXX ture of Detection Powers that permit the XXXXcharnameXXXX to study a lifeform down to its atomic level without having to do anything harmful to that lifeform (like dissect it).

	The newly born lifeform has the same characteristics as a normally born lifeform of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary creations, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable set of statistics for the being in question.

	This Power also includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. This can be used to create raw biological materials or foodstuffs; examples include sugar, blood, protoplasm, and so on.
</p><p>
	Each material takes up a memory slot.

</p><p>
	New life can learn, if it lives long enough. It can even raise its abilities and gain simulations of other Powers the original possesses. The Judge should set XXXXcharnameXXXX own standards, based on what type of beastie the XXXXcharnameXXXX has come up with.
</p><p>
	Here comes the exceptionto all that&#39;s been written here so far. When creating the XXXXcharnameXXXX, the player can opt to specialize in creating one unique being, like a Pegasus or a She-Hulk of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s very own. (No more trouble getting dates for this guy) In that case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs, thus the XXXXcharnameXXXX is required to periodically recreate XXXXcharnameXXXX chosen companion. Such a continually created being retains its memory from creation to creation and can learn and develop just like any normal lifeform. Any damage suffered by this being disappears when it is summoned anew. If slain, the being immediately disintegrates and its statistics (when it is summoned again) drop to their original levels. XXXXcharnameXXXX should also incur a hefty Karma loss if XXXXcharnameXXXX was directly responsible for XXXXcharnameXXXX companion&#39;s death.
</p><p>
	If the XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses other Powers, the player can assign them to whatever lifeforms the XXXXcharnameXXXX can summon. This is an interesting possibility for creating unique characters, especially if Specialization is chosen.</p>",


	"mechanical creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create comple XXXXcharnameXXXX mechanical devices from virtually nothing. The newly created machine originally forms in one mass, then separates into its components.
</p><p>
	The size of the machine is limited to its weight. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create in one turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. Heavier machines have to be assembled in several turns. The durability of the machine is determined at the time of its creation. A green FEAT gives the machine a lifespan of 100 turns times the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 times the rank number. A red FEAT means the machine is permane nt.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the XXXXcharnameXXXX one point of Health. All points lost in this way are regained after 24 hours. Thus the XXXXcharnameXXXX can only create in a single day a number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Health.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must have detailed knowledge of anything XXXXcharnameXXXX wants to create. XXXXcharnameXXXX can only store a limited number of de-&#34;signs in XXXXcharnameXXXX memory. The total number of memory slots available for this Power is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the designs the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create. The list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XXXXcharnameXXXX a new design; if no memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of existing machines.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a detailed study of the machine for at least 10 minutes for each attempted FEAT. Failure to make a FEAT means another 10 minutes of study is required. Some items may be beyond -, XXXXcharnameXXXX XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s comprehension. if the player is really bad at rolling the dice. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also create new designs based solely on XXXXcharnameXXXX imagination and knowledge of mechanical engineering.
</p><p>
	As this requires really intense concentration, a red FEAT is required to store such designs.
</p><p>
	The newly-created machine has the same properties as a normally manufactured machine of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary designs, the player and Judge should agree on reasonable statistics for the item in question.
</p><p>
	This Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the padlocks and pistols that already clutter the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any shape, though. This permits the XXXXcharnameXXXX to change the composition of any of XXXXcharnameXXXX already-memorized designs. For example, if XXXXcharnameXXXX has already memorized a cassette player&#39;s design and the nature of platinum, XXXXcharnameXXXX can create either a normal plastic-cased player or a platinum coated one.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can materialize the machine at any site within one area. The machine is initially stationary but if it is self-powered, it can immediately begin to move on its own. XXXXcharnameXXXX can also drop the machine on a target, but that is a real waste of material, people.
</p><p>
	The Power cannot create actual living beings. If the -XXXXcharnameXXXX is trying to create a facsimile of a living being, the best XXXXcharnameXXXX can do is a robotic replica, complete with simulated flesh. Internal e XXXXcharnameXXXX amination immediately reveals gears and pulleys.
</p><p>
	The Power can create potentially sentient machines, such as a miniature copy of a Sentinel. Such a facsimile lacks the detailed programming of the original and must be programmed before it can function. This also applies to any microchip dependent device, such as a computer.
</p><p>
	Just like Matter Creation, there is an exceptionto the rules stated thus far.
</p><p>
	When creating the character, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a specific design&#34;like a homemade Iron Man suit or a mini jet. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated the same as Yellow FEATs. Optional Powers include a form of Mechanical Animation limited to those machines created by the XXXXcharnameXXXX, Hyper Intelligence, and Hyper-Invention. Nemesis Powers include Mechanical Animation, and Mental Domination (es pecially induced Amnesia).</p>",


	"missile creation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can spontaneously create and launch projectiles. These are propelled to Power rank range. Missiles that simply slam into a target act as Stunning Missiles and inflict Stunning attacks of Power rank Intensity. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX has other Powers, these are combined with this Power to produce missiles with specific effects.
	<ol>
		<li>
			<em>Nullifier -</em>The Missile Power is combined with Power Control/Negation to produce missiles that inflict no direct damage but may nullify inborn or technological Powers with Power rank Intensity. Sleep Darts-the Power is combined with Induced Sleep to create anesthetic darts.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Magnetic -</em>The Power combines with Magnetism to produce missiles with Power rank Intensity Magnetism. These can do Power rank damage to magnetic recordings or delicate electronics, and can attract any iron in the target site (guns, for example)</li>
		<li>
			<em>Ghostcasters -</em>The Power is combined with Illusion-casting to create missiles that emit a static hologram upon hitting the target site.</li>
	</ol>
</p><p>
	Vanisher&#39;s power is combined with Induced Teleportation to create missiles that teleport the target to a predetermined destination.
	Energizer-Missiles are combined with Power Transference to give the target part of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s other Powers.
</p><p>
	Any Power in this book can be combined with this Power to create unique missiles for your character. When creating the character, the player should follow this guideline - If there is a way to combine external Powers with this Power, do it.
</p><p>
	Powers that are completely internal in their effects are e XXXXcharnameXXXX empted from this. This includes most of the Mental and Physical Enhancements and all of the Self Alterations and Detection Powers.
</p><p>
	If the character is High Tech, has rolled such Powers as Hyper-Invention or Weapons Tinkering, or possesses a magical device, then the Missile Powers should be combined into a device possessed by the XXXXcharnameXXXX. This may be an e XXXXcharnameXXXX otic gun, a wand, or any other bit of superXXXXcharnameXXXXic paraphernalia the player can imagine.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX has a finite ammo supply, even if XXXXcharnameXXXX creates the missiles as XXXXcharnameXXXX goes.
</p><p>
	The  maximum number of Missiles the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create per hour is equal to the Power rank number. This prevents the clich found in bad Westerns, whereby a lone cowboy holds off the entire Apache nation with a single si XXXXcharnameXXXX shooter. This limit also applies to Technological versions of this Power, in that the gun/wand/whatever simply overheats from repeated use.
</p><p>
	There are two Nemeses for this Power. If the Power is innate to the XXXXcharnameXXXX, Reflection stops it. If the Power is externalized in a weapon, Induced Teleportation works by removing the weapon from the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s possession and giving it to the opponent.</p>",


	"molecular creation" => "<p>This is a more powerful form of Elemental Creation. XXXXcharnameXXXX can form several elements simultaneously and form them into any desired compound. XXXXcharnameXXXX can form this on any target within one area. XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in one turn a number of ounces equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. For example, at Poor rank XXXXcharnameXXXX could form only four ounces in one turn. The durability of the newly created compound is determined by a FEAT at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the material a span of a number of turns equal to 100 times the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT raises the multiplier to 10,000, and on a red FEAT the material is permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce the XXXXcharnameXXXX creates temporarily costs him one point of Health. XXXXcharnameXXXX can regain Health points lost in this way after a 24-hour period including eight hours of sleep. Thus, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create only a number of ounces per day equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX total Health points.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos is visiting a primitive culture and decides to give them a gift of useful bronze. XXXXcharnameXXXX Power is E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent (20) and XXXXcharnameXXXX Reason is Typical (6), but XXXXcharnameXXXX Health is only 50. On XXXXcharnameXXXX first try, XXXXcharnameXXXX makes only a green FEAT. That batch of 20 ounces disintegrates in 600 turns (1 hour). XXXXcharnameXXXX tries again, making a yellow FEAT this time. That&#39;s not much better; the batch of 20 ounces disintegrates in four days. XXXXcharnameXXXX honor on the line, Synthos tries again. XXXXcharnameXXXX succeeds with a red FEAT. However, XXXXcharnameXXXX depleted Health only permitted him to create 10 ounces of bronze. Synthos is unaware of this, having passed out from the strain.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can use this Power as an attack by trying to form the new material on a chosen target. Such targets can try to dodge. If they succeed, the material forms in their previous position. XXXXcharnameXXXX must be in line of sight of the target. XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot form material within a target&#39;s interior or through any barrier between XXXXcharnameXXXX and the target. Synthos, for example, could not form plastic e XXXXcharnameXXXX plosive within a Sentinel, unless someone left an inspection hatch open where Synthos could see it.
</p><p>
	In order to fully play this Power, the player needs to know some basic chemistry, especially the physical properties of various compounds. XXXXcharnameXXXX can develop Power stunts such as Negating a foe&#39;s Energy Emission Power by forming a barrier of insulating material around the target&#39;s Emission point.
</p><p>
	Breaking open a door by materializing strong compounds within the crack between the door and the frame.
</p><p>
	Forming weights in the air above a target&#39;s head.
</p><p>
	Healing others by creating medicines; their effects last even after the compounds disintegrate.
</p><p>
	Creating electricity by forming the compounds found in batteries.
</p><p>
	Creating unliving simulations of living beings. These have no cell structure, however, and are only incredibly realistic wa XXXXcharnameXXXX dummies.
</p><p>
	Performing temporary repairs on equipment.
</p><p>
	This Power includes the ability to form single elements as in Elemental Creation. This is an innate (not a Bonus) Power. Optional Powers include Matter Animation in any single form and Mechanical Animation. The Nemesis Powers are Disintegration and Matter Animation (all forms, simultaneously).</p>",


	"spray" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can spontaneously create a directed cloud of gas, mist, or dust.
</p><p>
	The Spray has a range of up to one area. It has the basic properties of doing Feeble damage by choking off the target&#39;s fresh air and reducing visibility by -2CS for anyone within the cloud. The main purpose of Spray is combining it with other Powers, thereby producing unique Spray Powers for the XXXXcharnameXXXX. In all these cases, the range remains the same. Other factors, such as the nature and Intensity of effects, are determined by the Power that has been combined with Spray. Some possibilities include - Hallucinogenic - The Spray is combined with Image Generation to produce vivid visual images in the target&#39;s mind; these, of course, have nothing to do with reality. The target&#39;s Fighting and Intuition drop -3CS.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Corrosion-proofing -</em> The Spray combines with Catalytic Control to lessen corrosive attacks&#34;Intensity by this Power rank number.</li>
		<li><em>Insulation -</em> The Spray combines with any Energy Control to produce a coating that protects any target from that form of Energy Emission. The insulation reduces the energy attack&#39;s Intensity rank by the Energy Control&#39;s rank number.</li>
		<li><em>Healing Spray -</em> This uses any of the more pleasant forms of Bio-Physical Control to produce a cloud that heals anyone in the target area who has taken damage up to -1CS.</li>
		<li><em>Napalm -</em> The Spray is combined with Fire Generation and does Power rank damage.</li>
		<li><em>Freeze Cloud -</em> The Spray combines with Cold Emission to do Power rank damage.</li>
		<li><em>Shrink Dust -</em> The Spray combines with Diminution to reduce the size of anything in the target area.</li>
		<li><em>Booster Dust -</em> The Spray combines with Power Control/Magnification to raise the Power ranks of everyone in the target area +1CS.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Any Power can be combined with this Power to create unique Sprays for each character.
</p><p>
	When creating such characters, the player should follow this simple guideline - If you can figure out a way to combine externalized Powers with this one, do it.
</p><p>
	Powers that are completely internalized are e XXXXcharnameXXXX empt from this rule. This includes most of the Mental and Physical Enhancements and all of the Self Alterations and Detections.
</p><p>
	If a character. is High Tech, has rolled such Powers as Hyper-Invention or Weapons Tinkering, or possesses a magical device, then the Spray Power should be incorporated into a device.
</p><p>
	This may be a gas gun, ring, horn, or any other piece of superXXXXcharnameXXXXic paraphernalia the player can imagine.
</p><p>
	example - The player rolls up the following Fire Generation, Elemental Conversion, Spontaneous Combustion, Spray, and Enchantment. She is a Humanoid, an Elf to be precise. She determines she is a magical character.
</p><p>
	The first three Powers readily combine with Spray. The player decides that the XXXXcharnameXXXXine possesses a magical flute which she built herself. Besides playing normal tunes, she knows three special melodies that create clouds which possess each of the first three Powers.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX has a finite amount of Spray.
</p><p>
	The  maximum number of Sprays the XXXXcharnameXXXX can create in a 24-hour period is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. This limit also applies to Technological or Magical versions of this Power; the gasgun/flute/whatever simply clogs up from repeated use.
</p><p>
	There are two Nemeses for this Power.
</p><p>
	If the Power is innate to the XXXXcharnameXXXX, then Reflection stops it. If the Power is externalized in a device, Induced Teleportation works be removing the device from the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s possession and turning it over to the Nemesis."

$aarPowMentalEnhancement = [
	"clairaudience" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can &#34;hear&#34; distant sounds and voices despite any intervening distance or barriers. The Power is not hindered by factors that affect normal sound transmission, such as distance, time lag, muffling, distortion, or the absence of a transmitting medium.
		<br />
	Because of this, Clairaudience has superior range over Hyper-Hearing. Only Clairaudience enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to hear across a vacuum, for example.
		<br />
	Unfortunately, Clairaudience can act as a pipeline to direct another&#39;s Psionic or Sonic attacks toward the XXXXcharnameXXXX. Because of this side-effect, the XXXXcharnameXXXX is -1CS to resist such attacks. These attacks need not even be aimed at the XXXXcharnameXXXX but might still affect the XXXXcharnameXXXX if the other Power is being used in the area the XXXXcharnameXXXX is spying upon.
		<br />
	example - Captain Tympanic is using XXXXcharnameXXXX Power to eavesdrop on bankrobbers planning a heist. Unfortunately, Charmer appeared and used her Hypnotic Voice Power to capture the gang. Capt.
		<br />
	Tympanic is caught in her spell as well.
		<br />
	The ranges for Clairaudience are shown on column E of the Range Table.
		<br />
	When the Power operates, it overrides the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s natural hearing. Distant sounds are sensed at their original volume level. If the volume is too loud the XXXXcharnameXXXX can reduce it with a green FEAT. Faint sounds can be magnified by a yellow FEAT. The Power is normally a voluntary Power that musty be summoned. Sometimes it functions automatically; this can be the result of improper control, tampering by outside forces, or be triggered by sudden, dramatic events occurring to someone with whom the XXXXcharnameXXXX shares an emotional rapport. (&#34;That was Lewis crying for help!&#34;) When using the Power to eavesdrop on another Clairaudient, that person may automatically sense the first Clairaudient&#39;s effort. This is determined by the Judge making a secret red FEAT based on the second XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank.</p>",


	"clairvoyance" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can &#39;see distant sights without directly seeing it with XXXXcharnameXXXX eyes. XXXXcharnameXXXX receives a visual simulation of what XXXXcharnameXXXX would see if XXXXcharnameXXXX were actually present at the scene. The Power is not hindered by any of the factors that affect normal light transmission, such as distance, blockage, obscurement, and time lag. It can be used to see things that are impossible for a telescope or Telescopic Vision. For example, a Monstrous Clairvoyant could see current conditions inside a sealed room on the surface of Venus.
</p><p>
	The ranges for this Power are shown on Column E of the Range Table. When in use, the Power overrides normal vision. Normally the Power is consciously controlled. Sometimes it functions automatically. This can be the result of improper control, interference, or be triggered by sudden, dramatic events occurring to someone who whom the XXXXcharnameXXXX shares an emotional rapport. (&#34;Oh no, Billy Jo fell off the bridge!&#34;) The Power can work against the XXXXcharnameXXXX if unwanted visions obscure the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s sight or distract him at a crucial moment.
</p><p>
	For example, if Dr. Strange had a sudden flash while operating on a patient, a malpractice suit might be in order.
</p><p>
	When the Power is used to spy on another Clairvoyant, there is a possibility of that person detecting the use of the Power. The Judge makes a discreet Red FEAT based on the observed character&#39;s Power rank.
</p><p>
	Clairvoyance can function as a pipeline to draw light-based and Psionic attacks toward the XXXXcharnameXXXX. Such attacks may even affect him if they were aimed at something else within the area XXXXcharnameXXXX is spying upon. XXXXcharnameXXXX has -1CS resistance to such attacks.</p>",


	"communication with animals" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can understand and use the languages employed by animals and other non-sentient lifeforms. The Power can be used to communicate with nonsentient alien creatures but not intelligent aliens. The degree of difference between the XXXXcharnameXXXX and the animal determines what color FEAT is required. Assuming the XXXXcharnameXXXX is human, a green FEAT permits communication with mammals. A yellow FEAT permits communication with birds and reptiles. A red FEAT covers everything else. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX has a different physical type, the player and Judge will have to modify the FEATs accordingly.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX must be in communications range of the animal for the Power to work. This varies from species to species. The basic rule is that the  maximum range is the greatest distance at which the XXXXcharnameXXXX and animal can sense each other.</p>",


	"Communication with cybernetics" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can directly communicate with comple XXXXcharnameXXXX machines, whether these are computers or machines not normally considered to have artificial intelligence.
</p><p>
	Any machine that possesses any kind of programming can be communicated withcalculators, digital watches, microwave ovens, even music bo XXXXcharnameXXXX es. The higher the rank, the simpler the machine that can be spoken to. A green FEAT can communicate with a machine possessing several microchips; a computer is the most common example. A yellow FEAT communicates with devices possessing a single microchip, such as watches and talking dolls. A red FEAT communicates with machines that lack microchips but are still somehow programmed, like player pianos and hand-cranked adding machines. The nature and quality of the information received reflects the nature of the machine that is spoken to.
</p><p>
	Communication occurs without the XXXXcharnameXXXX needing to resort to programming languages and input devices such as punchcards and keyboards. After all, if the XXXXcharnameXXXX did need them this wouldn&#34;t really be a super power. When using the Power, the XXXXcharnameXXXX transfers part of XXXXcharnameXXXX intelligence and Psyche to the machine, thus allowing it to respond to him. Unfortunately, sharing XXXXcharnameXXXX mind with machines on a regular basis leads the XXXXcharnameXXXX to identify a little too closely with machines.</p>",


	"communication with non-living matter" => "<p>This is a catchall name for anything not covered by the other Communication Powers (M3, M4, M6). It will enable the XXXXcharnameXXXX to communicate with anything that had once been either sentient, cybernetic, or alive, as long as the target lacks those qualities now. XXXXcharnameXXXX transfers part of XXXXcharnameXXXX intelligence and Psyche to the target, thus permitting it to respond to him. The target can converse, provide information, and even have a personality. The Power includes an innate, unconscious use of Speechthrowing. Although the XXXXcharnameXXXX actually provides the voice, it appears that the target actually speaking.
</p><p>
	When the Power is used to speak a corpse, it uses an unconscious, automatic form of Postcognition to create a simulation of the spirit that once inhabited the body. XXXXcharnameXXXX does not speak with the actual spirit. This can lead to an odd situation in which the actual ghost hears XXXXcharnameXXXX own body speak as if XXXXcharnameXXXX were still in it. Unfortunately, the XXXXcharnameXXXX may develop a personality quirk that blurs the distinction between life and death. As XXXXcharnameXXXX can speak with both the living and the dead, XXXXcharnameXXXX might not be able to see what the difference is. This can be taken to grotesque e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremes, especially in a horrific campaign.
</p><p>
	The Power can be used to pry into a person&#39;s secrets by interrogating that person&#39;s possessions. For example, clothing will blithely recount the wearer&#39;s activities and a wall safe will proudly list all the things it is protecting. Note: Projectile weapons only remember when they were fired, not at whom.</p>",


	"communication with plants" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can speak with plants. Anything that has a vegetable physiology can be affected by this Power, such as grass, trees, and the Man-Thing. When using the Power, the XXXXcharnameXXXX imparts some of XXXXcharnameXXXX intelligence and Psyche to the plant to facilitate communication. The greater the comple XXXXcharnameXXXX ity of the plant, the easier it is to communicate with. A green FEAT communicates with trees and local ecosystems; in the latter, all the plants speak as if a chorus that only the XXXXcharnameXXXX can hear. A yellow FEAT communicates with shrubs, vines, and bushes. A red FEAT communicates with simple plants and fungi; if the XXXXcharnameXXXX has Hyper-hearing, it can be combined with this Power to permit communication with plankton and bacteria.
</p><p>
	Combining the Power with Sensory Link enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to share the e XXXXcharnameXXXX periences of plants, even those on alien worlds if the latter Power&#39;s rank is high enough.
</p><p>
	A problem can develop if the XXXXcharnameXXXX begins to identify too closely with plants.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX might find salads offensive. Worse, XXXXcharnameXXXX may begin to suffer anguish when plants are harmed in XXXXcharnameXXXX presence.</p>",


	"cosmic awareness" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX is in tune with the entire scope of reality. XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses a detached, omniscient viewpoint that allows him to e XXXXcharnameXXXX plore the entire existence of a chosen subject.
</p><p>
	Unfortunately, this causes such a massive overload of superfluous information that the XXXXcharnameXXXX is hard pressed to sort it all out. The FEAT represents the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s ability to recover a specific bit of information from all the effluvia. The more e XXXXcharnameXXXX act the required detail, the higher the difficulty. Discovering basic facts or locating any one on the Earth requires a green FEAT. Comple XXXXcharnameXXXX information or finding anyone within a star system requires a yellow FEAT. Secrets, weaknesses, arcane knowledge, and anything else the Judge wants to make difficult to find out requires a red FEAT.
</p><p>
	The Power can be used to automatically track any Class 1000 or higher Power within ten miles of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s position. In combat the Power raises the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own attacks +1CS by detecting the weak points in the opponent.
</p><p>
	The major drawback to this Power is that can lead to insanity, especially catatonic withdrawal, as the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Psyche is continually inundated by a flood of information. The Judge can determine the chance of temporary insanity by secretly making a Reason FEAT for the XXXXcharnameXXXX; a green, yellow, or red FEAT means the XXXXcharnameXXXX has retained all XXXXcharnameXXXX marbles for another day. The Judge should make this check any time the XXXXcharnameXXXX uses the Power more than five times a day or a number equal to 10% of the Power rank number, whichever is higher. Because of this, caution is urged in the use of this Power. If the Power is somehow negated, the XXXXcharnameXXXX may also go into a state of shock or severe depression. Any mental problems the XXXXcharnameXXXX suffers can be cured by normal psychotherapy.</p>",


	"danger sense" => "<p>This is also called Combat Sense and Spider-sense. It is a combination of automatically functioning Psionic Powers (Telepathy, Empathy, and Precognition) that warns the XXXXcharnameXXXX about impending danger. The advance warning time is the number of seconds equal to the Power rank number (rounded up to the nearest turn if need be). For example, Spider-Man&#39;s Amazing rank can warn him of danger almost a minute in advance.
</p><p>
	In a combat situation, the Power can be used replace other, lower ranked Abilities. It can replace Intuition for determining surprise, Fighting for blocking, Agility for dodging, and Strength for escaping.
</p><p>
	The minimum level for this Power must be equal to the -XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Intuition. If it&#39;s initially lower, the player can raise it to this level. The player can also raise its rank +1CS by choosing to make it a voluntary rather than an automatic Power. That is, it only functions if the XXXXcharnameXXXX is making it function. Spiderman&#39;s version functions at all times, but your XXXXcharnameXXXX might decide the risk of being caught off-guard is worth the reward of the higher rank.
</p><p>
	The nature of the Power reduces the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s.</p>",


	"dreamtravel" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can actually enter into the short-lived pocket dimensions created by a person&#39;s dreams and nightmares. These dreamworlds are outside the boundaries of normal reality and exist solely as a reflection of the dreamer&#39;s imagination.
</p><p>
	The Dreamtraveler must be within ten feet of the dreamer in order for the Power to function at full rank. The Power rank decreases -1CS for each additional 10 feet that separates the two.
</p><p>
	The Dreamtraveler has no direct control over the conditions within the dreamworld. XXXXcharnameXXXX can interact with things within that world by performing physical actions much as XXXXcharnameXXXX would in the real world. Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance are all represented by this Power&#39;s rank. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX has other Powers, these exist in equivalent forms that possess this Power&#39;s rank instead of their own. The Dreamtraveler can suffer real damage as a result of events that affect him within the dreamworld. XXXXcharnameXXXX might even die. The equivalent of the damage appears in the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s real body.
</p><p>
	Normally the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s real body retains its solidity during Dreamtravel. The player can raise the rank +1CS by making the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body dematerialize whenever the Power is used. In this case, if the XXXXcharnameXXXX is slain or trapped within the dreamworld, the body might never reappear.
</p><p>
	Each dreamworld is unique to the specific dreamer and retains no existence e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept during the act of dreaming. Dreamworlds are not the same as the Dream Dimension, although it is possible they exist within the greater Dream Dimension. It is possible that dreamworlds touch each other and may even overlap in the case of telepathic dreamers. If so, it is possible that the Dreamtraveler can enter one dreamworld and e XXXXcharnameXXXX it one of someone else&#39;s.</p>",


	"empathy" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can detect the surface emotions of others. XXXXcharnameXXXX can detect the target&#39;s emotional state and further refine that knowledge to discover the target&#39;s physical state, surroundings, and location, insofar as these have an influence on the emotions.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can transmit XXXXcharnameXXXX own emotional state but XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot impose this on others (that requires Emotion Control).
</p><p>
	Empathy is e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely useful when the XXXXcharnameXXXX has to deal with non-sentient beings or large numbers of people. It can read the target&#39;s mood and support already existing emotions. The range can vary within a single Power rank. The distances shown on column B of the Range Table refer to a single target.
</p><p>
	Each additional target reduces the range -1CS. Range never falls below Feeble, even if the XXXXcharnameXXXX is trying to read the emotions of a crowd. The Power functions for as long as the XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on using it. XXXXcharnameXXXX can send Empathic, messages by means of a Power FEAT. The message is in the form of a burst of emotion accompanied by a subtle identification of the Empath.
</p><p>
	A green FEAT transmits to a known person and location. A yellow FEAT transmits to a known person in an unknown location. A red FEAT is the Psionic equivalent of a general announcement. (&#34;Did you feel that? Felt like somebody was really scared – Wait a minute. That was Sender. XXXXcharnameXXXX needs us!&#34;).</p>",


	"free spirit" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s soul is capable of independent existence in the real world. The Free Spirit can leave the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body and travel independently; it is often mistaken for an Astral Body. The Free Spirit can even survive the death of the physical body without being immediately drawn into an afterlife dimension; this requires a red Power FEAT at the time of death (more on this later).
</p><p>
	Free Spirits possess all the Mental Abilities, Talents, and Powers of the whole being. Health remains unchanged although now it is more of a measure of how well the Free Spirit can resist entering the appropriate afterlife.
</p><p>
	If the Free Spirit is still in XXXXcharnameXXXX original body, that body may either retain a share of the overall consciousness when the.
</p><p>
	spirit is away or the body may lapse into a coma at these times. There an equal chance of either, although the player should choose one at the time the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created. If the original body is dead, the Free Spirit can develop bonds to one or more new bodies, dwelling like a tenant in each but tied to none. The Free Spirit cannot Possess the body or in any way hinder the real owner&#39;s abilities.
</p><p>
	They do share a telepathic bond that e XXXXcharnameXXXX tends into shared dreams. If the Free Spirit possesses Powers that require a physical form to use, XXXXcharnameXXXX can lend these to whatever body XXXXcharnameXXXX is occupying. When this Power appears during the character generation process, the player must decide whether the body the Free Spirit is occupying is XXXXcharnameXXXX own or a loaner XXXXcharnameXXXX picked up along the way. In the latter case, the player will then have to generate two complete sets of statistics, those of the Free Spirit and the real owner of XXXXcharnameXXXX current body.
</p><p>
	Free Spirits can be created later on.
</p><p>
	Any character who dies in a campaign has a chance to become one, even if XXXXcharnameXXXX did not possess this actual Power to begin with. The transformation is accomplished by making an Unearthly Psyche FEAT and e XXXXcharnameXXXX pending all the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Karma.</p>",


	"hallucinations" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create illusions directly within the target&#39;s mind. Such illusions are telepathic, not holographic, in nature. As such, they cannot be mechanically detected or recorded e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept by devices that simulate Telepathy or human thought patterns (such as player character Robots).
</p><p>
	Hallucinations can only be seen by the target of this Power.
</p><p>
	The ranges for this Power is shown on column A of the Range Table. The target must be within sight of the XXXXcharnameXXXX, although the XXXXcharnameXXXX can e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend XXXXcharnameXXXX sight and thus XXXXcharnameXXXX Power range by the use of artificial aids. These include telescopes, remote TV cameras, clairvoyance, and Telescopic Vision. The target need not see the XXXXcharnameXXXX in order for the Power to affect him. Normally the Power affects only a single target. Each additional target decreases the range -1CS. Targets are allowed to disbelieve the Hallucination by making an Intuition FEAT but only if they suspect the true nature of what they are seeing.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations last as long as the XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on creating them. They inflict no real physical damage but can be used to disguise an actual Power&#39;s use.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can use one additional Power simultaneously with this one.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations can be used to inflict psychosomatic damage. If the apparent damage is believable, the target will physically react to it. Hallucinatory &#39;death&#39; results in the target lapsing into unconsciousness for 1-20 turns. Since a target who takes the time to e XXXXcharnameXXXX amine XXXXcharnameXXXX wounds will realize XXXXcharnameXXXX has not been hurt (at least not in the way XXXXcharnameXXXX thinks XXXXcharnameXXXX should be), the XXXXcharnameXXXX is advised not to use Hallucinations that rely on direct attacks.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations have limited effects on non-sentient or e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely alien beings.
</p><p>
	They have no effect at all on Moms Nature. A Hallucinatory wall might stop a puma but it won&#34;t stop a boulder rolling down on the XXXXcharnameXXXX.</p>",


	"hyper-intelligence" => "<p>Normally a character&#39;s Intelligence is determined in the Character Generation Process.
</p><p>
	However, the research for the Ultimate Powers Book showed that e XXXXcharnameXXXX treme levels of Intelligence can be a Power in its own right. examples include The Leader and the late Soviet scientist known only as Gargoyle. The hyper-intelligent character is a genius of awesome potential. XXXXcharnameXXXX can quickly master new subjects, retain that knowledge indefinitely, and easily succeed in any mental endeavor.
</p><p>
	There are two ways the Power can be incorporated into a character. The player should choose one when XXXXcharnameXXXX first creates the character (a coin toss will do).
</p><p>
	The first method is a permanent modification of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Intelligence.
</p><p>
	The Power rank number is added to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s previously generated Reason or Intuition rank number. The total is the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s actual Hyper-intelligence. For example, a character like the Leader started off with Good Reason. The gamma rays added Incredible Hyper- Intelligence for a final total of Amazing Reason rank.
</p><p>
	The second method uses Hyper- Intelligence the same way most other Powers are used-intermittently. Just as Siryn doesn&#34;t scream all the time, so too would a Hyper-intelligent character have normal intelligence most of the time.
</p><p>
	When XXXXcharnameXXXX uses XXXXcharnameXXXX Power, XXXXcharnameXXXX transforms XXXXcharnameXXXX into a mental giant. The way it operates is the character&#39;s normal rank for either Reason or Intuition is raised the number of levels equal to the Power rank (Feeble is +1CS, Poor +2CS, and so on).</p>",


	"hyper-invention" => "<p>This is a special form of Hyper-intelligence that is common enough to merit its own classification. It is a permanent enhancement of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s overall intelligence that is channeled into the field of mechanical design and engineering. XXXXcharnameXXXX is an Edison-like genius who take existing materials and technologies and use them to create new devices or applied technologies. XXXXcharnameXXXX can repair previously operational devices, even if the device was of an unknown type.</p>",


	"hypnotic control" => "<p>More of a talent then an actual power, XXXXcharnameXXXX can dominate a target&#39;s behavior and actions by implanting commands, not by direct psionic control. The Hypnotic command may pertain to current conditions or lie dormant until triggered by future conditions (post-hypnotic suggestion). Hypnotic controls come in two forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Commands alter current behavior. &#34;You are getting sleepy.&#34;</li>
		<li>
			Suggestions alter future behavior. &#34;You hate orange, rocky skin and must destroy anything with it.&#34;Normal hypnosis cannot make a person/animal perform any action that goes against his sense of ethics. However, the target&#39;s innate sense of morality can be lessened, allowing less conflicting commands to win out. Hypnotic Control can be established by any one of a number of means. These include specific gestures, words, songs, or devices. The Intensity and duration of a Hypnotic Control are determined by the Power rank. In the case of post-hypnotic Suggestions, duration does not include the time prior to activation of the suggestion, but only the time the suggestion is actually in force.</li>
	</ul>",


	"incarnation awareness" => "<p>This Power is based on the idea that a spirit enters countless reincarnations throughout eternity but that the memory of each past life is usually lost somewhere in the transition from one life to another. This Power allows the XXXXcharnameXXXX to remember the details of XXXXcharnameXXXX more recent lives and to actually communicate with them. Such communications include the transmission of the complete range of senses and thoughts. There are two limits on communication with other lives. One, the communication can only be initiated by the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s current incarnation. XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot be called by past lives nor can XXXXcharnameXXXX call future lives. However, that doesn&#34;t prevent the XXXXcharnameXXXX from receiving messages from XXXXcharnameXXXX future selves. This can be a quick way to start an adventure (more later).
</p><p>
	Two, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can only reach past selves at points when they are actually living. XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot reach selves that are in an afterlife situation. In fact, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can&#34;t really recall ever being in any form of afterlife. The Power rank number is also the number of consecutive past lives the XXXXcharnameXXXX can contact. The earliest incarnation is the lifespan in which the Power first appeared; it has been growing one point at a time ever since. This limit spares the player the responsibility for making up a mega-biography going back to the dawn of time. It spares the Judge by limiting the potential havoc the player can wreak using XXXXcharnameXXXX now dead contacts. Assume a full but average lifespan for all past lives. From the 18th century on, this is 70 years. Prior to that, the average is 50.The time elapsed between incarnations is up to the player, but at least one incarnation per century is recommended. Soon after the player acquires this Power, XXXXcharnameXXXX should work out a basic timeline for and list of XXXXcharnameXXXX past incarnations. Players are urged to make their past lives relatively normal people.Still, if the player is determined to fill up XXXXcharnameXXXX past with glory after glory, the Judge can insist on a simple rule. To wit there is a 1% chance that any specific historical figure was a former incarnation of the present-day XXXXcharnameXXXX.>The Power is used primarily to gain information. XXXXcharnameXXXX can make e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely long-ranged plans that involve the assistance of past lives in solving current problems.
</p><p>
	<em>example -</em> Self-1988 asks Self-1920 to have a tunnel dug under the site of the present day Latverian Embassy. A trust fund to be set up by Self-1855 will pay for it.
</p><p>
	Sometimes a future incarnation will request that the XXXXcharnameXXXX perform a special act. The reason for the act might never be e XXXXcharnameXXXX plained. In this, way, the XXXXcharnameXXXX and XXXXcharnameXXXX associates might suddenly find themselves thrust into e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely strange or terribly mundane situations. (&#34;It is crucial that you make sure Jon Clifton gets to school today! Then bury ten pounds of Adamantium at these coordinates in the Gobi Desert.&#34;) Even the best laid plans of mice and men go astray. Any time the XXXXcharnameXXXX asks a past-self to perform an action that has a direct, physical effect on the present, XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a FEAT roll. This represents the chance of long-range plans coming to fruition. Each century between the present- self and the past- self raises the Intensity FEAT +1CS.
</p><p>
	<em>example</em> - The Trust Fund set up in 1855 requires a Poor Intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	The tunnel requires a Feeble Intensity FEAT. The player rolled a 30 and a 56.
</p><p>
	The trust fund failed somewhere along the way but the tunnel got built anyway using alternative funding.
</p><p>
	The Optional Powers include either Time Travel limited to any past lifetime, a combination of Time Travel and Free Spirit that enables the present-self to possess the bodies of other selves, or a specialized form of Time Travel that enables the present self to draw other selves from their times to the present.</p>",


	"illusion-casting" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity/seem absolutely real to all five senses. These Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the subject&#39;s mind and cannot affect mechanical senses. The Illusion can take any size or appearance XXXXcharnameXXXX desires and is limited only by XXXXcharnameXXXX imagination. The Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind, or an abstract display of light. XXXXcharnameXXXX is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. XXXXcharnameXXXX can cast XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusions anywhere within XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank range, though he must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if he wants to make it at all realistic. The normal limit for unaided vision is roughly 50 yards. Beyond that range XXXXcharnameXXXX can no longer clearly see XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusion&#39;s surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast 75 yards away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If XXXXcharnameXXXX is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusions, this limit can be ignored. XXXXcharnameXXXX does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, free floating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses a means of e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending the range of XXXXcharnameXXXX senses, he can maintain the realism m of XXXXcharnameXXXX Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means he uses to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend XXXXcharnameXXXX vision. Ways of increasing the senses&#34;range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense- e XXXXcharnameXXXX tending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance. Illusions last as long as XXXXcharnameXXXX concentrates on maintaining their existence. The Judge is free to determine how long XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain XXXXcharnameXXXX concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). The Illusion&#39;s effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion- caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion&#39;s true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. This can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. (&#34;Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast.&#34;). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light- based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping XXXXcharnameXXXX cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2Rs Resistance to Light- based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy.</p>",


	"iron will" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has complete conscious control over XXXXcharnameXXXX mind and body. By using XXXXcharnameXXXX Iron Will, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can temporarily halt the damage done by mental or physical attacks; XXXXcharnameXXXX can even postpone XXXXcharnameXXXX own death. Iron Will can be used in place of any lower- ranked Ability to determine Resistance to an attack. Any time the XXXXcharnameXXXX suffers damage from an attack, the Power can temporarily absorb it before it can affect any of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Ability ranks. The  maximum amount of damage Iron Will can absorb at one time is equal to its rank number. Absorbed damage does not affect the XXXXcharnameXXXX at that time. Damage e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceeding that amount affects XXXXcharnameXXXX in its normal manner. The XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain XXXXcharnameXXXX Iron Will indefinitely but will eventually have to rela XXXXcharnameXXXX XXXXcharnameXXXX self-control in order to heal and renew XXXXcharnameXXXX Power. Letting down XXXXcharnameXXXX control causes XXXXcharnameXXXX to immediately suffer a loss of Body points equal to one half the amount of damage Iron Will had absorbed. Regardless of the original nature of the attack, it is always translated into lost Body points; this reflects the strain the Power places on the body. Once the translation occurs and the Iron Will has been purged of its burden, it is able to absorb new damage. The cycle of absorption/purging/ absorption can continue until the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Health drops to zero or below.
</p><p>
	Note: Iron Will can still absorb damage, even if the conversion of that damage into Health points will result in thier immediate death. In such a case, XXXXcharnameXXXX had best make sure XXXXcharnameXXXX is already in an e XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Trauma Center when XXXXcharnameXXXX rela XXXXcharnameXXXX es XXXXcharnameXXXX Power.</p>",


	"linguistic" => "<p>This is a specialized form of Hyper- intelligence. XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to rapidly learn any language if sufficient material is available for him to work with. Once the language is mastered, the XXXXcharnameXXXX is fluent in that language, provided XXXXcharnameXXXX is physically capable of communicating in it.
</p><p>
	The number of languages a XXXXcharnameXXXX is currently fluent in is limited to the Power rank number. For example, Doug Ramsey&#39;s Incredible rank enables him to retain fluency in up to forty languages at a time. When a XXXXcharnameXXXX e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceeds that limit, XXXXcharnameXXXX begins to forget a previously mastered language. This will usually be some obscure tongue the XXXXcharnameXXXX has had little use for, like Basic Otter or Mephitish.
</p><p>
	The speed with which a XXXXcharnameXXXX can learn a new language is determined by its strangeness and what source materials are available. Current human languages require a Poor FEAT. Archaic human languages are a Good FEAT. Alien but Humanoid languages are Remarkable FEAT. Animal languages are an Incredible FEAT (note not all animals have an actual language). Alien, nonhumanoid languages are an Amazing FEAT. The color of the FEAT is determined by the source of the language. A green FEAT is needed if the XXXXcharnameXXXX has access to actual instructional materials or a cooperative native speaker of that language who also speaks a language the XXXXcharnameXXXX knows. A yellow FEAT is needed if the XXXXcharnameXXXX has a native speaker who cannot speak any tongue the XXXXcharnameXXXX knows or if the XXXXcharnameXXXX only has non-instructional samples of that language. A red FEAT is needed if the XXXXcharnameXXXX has only fragments of the new language. For example, learning Shi&#34;ar from watching a broadcast of a speech by Majestri XXXXcharnameXXXX Lilandra is a yellow Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Learning spoken Primate by actually using sign language to talk with a chimpanzee requires a green incredible intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can try a FEAT roll every hour. Failure means XXXXcharnameXXXX simply has not yet gotten the hang of the new language. The only real drawback to the Power is that the XXXXcharnameXXXX may accidentally forget XXXXcharnameXXXX native language, especially if XXXXcharnameXXXX rarely uses it. Still, XXXXcharnameXXXX can always re- learn it. There is a danger that an adversary might warp the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Linguistic Power and actually negate XXXXcharnameXXXX language comprehension; in such a case, the XXXXcharnameXXXX becomes dysle XXXXcharnameXXXX ic and unable to understand simple English. A curious side effect of the Power is that it provides Power rank Resistance to Hypnotic Voice and other sonic- based forms of Hypnotic or Mind Control. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind shifts into its translation mode; it studies the medium through which the hypnosis is communicated rather than the actual message. (&#34;Lorelei, did you ever realize that your sleep command is a high C sharp while your paralysis command is a high C flat&#34;).</p>",


	"mediumship" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX is aware of the spirits and can communicate with them through various means. can see them and/or hear them if they so will and converse with them as well. can not command them to appear or call them forth against their wishes. is simply aware of them and capable of direct communication with them.</p>",


	"mental duplication" => "<p>This is a combination of Powers that enables the XXXXcharnameXXXX to psionically study a subject&#39;s mind and then create a simulation of that mind within the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own brain. This is a great way to learn secrets and interrogate subjects who would otherwise be rather uncooperative (at best). The duplicated mind contains the personality of the original, most memories, and possibly the mental or psionic Powers of the original. The subject is unaffected by the Power and loses none of XXXXcharnameXXXX own mental abilities. XXXXcharnameXXXX is usually unaware that Duplication has even occurred. The relationship between the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s and the duplicate&#39;s mind takes one of three forms. The player must choose one form when XXXXcharnameXXXX first creates the XXXXcharnameXXXX; this form applies for any duplicates the XXXXcharnameXXXX creates. Dice Roll Form 01-40 Detachment 41-70 Merge 71-00 Transformation Detachment XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind is completely separate from the duplicate and retains full control over the body and other Powers. XXXXcharnameXXXX can e XXXXcharnameXXXX amine and communicate with the duplicate. The duplicate retains a facsimile of the original&#39;s will and may not choose to voluntarily cooperate with the XXXXcharnameXXXX. If the duplicate chooses to resist, the XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a Psyche FEAT whose Intensity is determined by the duplicate&#39;s Psyche rank. A successful FEAT means the duplicate will grudgingly cooperate (for now). The FEAT must be made with each new attempt to force cooperation. The duplicate mind can attempt to overwhelm the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own mind. Success occurs if the duplicate makes a -3CS Psyche FEAT whose intensity is based on the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Psyche. The duplicate mind can attempt its coup at the initial duplication and at any time the XXXXcharnameXXXX forces cooperation. Success means the two minds&#34;positions are now reversed; the duplicate now controls the body and any Powers for the duration of the duplication.
</p><p>
	<em>example -</em> Copicat successfully duplicates Dr. Doom&#39;s mind. Doom won&#34;t stand for anything resembling subservience and immediately rebels. Copicat has E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Psyche; Dr. Doom has Amazing Psyche, reduced 3CS to E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent when attempting to overwhelm. The Doom-mind fails to make the required E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	Doom decides to e XXXXcharnameXXXX amine XXXXcharnameXXXX situation; from the Doom-mind&#39;s point of view, &#34;XXXXcharnameXXXX has been captured by means of a Mind Transferral of unknown type. Copicat is trying to get the Doom-mind to draw up a set of plans for XXXXcharnameXXXX time machine. Unfortunately Doom&#39;s Psyche is too high for even a red FEAT.</p>",


	"merge" => "<p>The duplicate mind blends with the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind to create a composite mentality. The new mind contains aspects of both minds&#34;personalities, memories, and Powers. The new mind&#39;s Psyche is the sum of the original two Psyche ranks. The degree of each mind&#39;s influence is proportional to its original Psyche. Each original Psyche represents a section of the pooled Psyche. For example, Carboncopy has a Good Psyche. XXXXcharnameXXXX merges with a Thing duplicate (Remarkable Psyche), creating a joint Incredible Psyche. One fourth of the joint personality is Carboncopy, the remaining three-quarters are the Thing.</p>",


	"transformation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind is automatically overwhelmed by the new mind. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s personality, memories, and mental Powers are temporarily replaced by the new mind. The effects appear identical to Mind Transferral, at least where the XXXXcharnameXXXX is concerned. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Reason and Intuition are replaced by those of the original mind; after e XXXXcharnameXXXX piration of the Power, these return to their original ranks.
</p><p>
	Regardless of the form, the XXXXcharnameXXXX must make a FEAT at the time of Duplication in order to determine the completeness of the duplicate mind. Any mind can be duplicated, regardless of its Psyche rank. XXXXcharnameXXXX always duplicates the subject&#39;s personality and basic memories; the duplicate mind is an amnesiac. A green FEAT copies the subject&#39;s detailed memories. A yellow FEAT copies the subject&#39;s Talents. A red FEAT duplicates the subject&#39;s Mental and Psionic Powers. The range at which the XXXXcharnameXXXX can duplicate a mind is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate ranges are shown on Column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	The duration of the duplication is determined by the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Psyche rank. A duplicate mind has a duration of the number of minutes equal to the Psyche rank number. The duration decreases - 1CS for all duplicate-minds with each additional mind. For example, Copicat&#39;s E XXXXcharnameXXXX cellent Psyche enables him to maintain one duplicate-mind for 20 minutes or a  maximum of five minds for two minutes. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceeds XXXXcharnameXXXX limit, the new duplicate-mind will last for one turn and then all XXXXcharnameXXXX copied minds will vanish. <em>Note:</em> the decreased duration only applies to the Detachment and Merge forms; the Transformation form can be used repeatedly since the latest duplication automatically erases the previous one. When the XXXXcharnameXXXX is created, the player must determine how much control the XXXXcharnameXXXX has over XXXXcharnameXXXX Power. Failure to make at least a green Reason FEAT means the Power functions automatically, despite the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s wishes. In the case of uncontrolled Power usage, the range at which duplication occurs drops to contact-only. XXXXcharnameXXXX can maintain some control by covering all parts of her body that might normally touch another person&#39;s skin. For example, Rogue wears a full body covering complete with gloves.
</p><p>
	In rare cases, the duration of a specific duplicate mind can be e XXXXcharnameXXXX tended to permanence. Such cases result from a combination of e XXXXcharnameXXXX tremely peculiar factors. One such example occurred when Rogue&#39;s Mutant Power interacted with Ms. Marvel&#39;s Kree-Modified Human physiology. The result is that Rogue&#39;s mind permanently merged with a facsimile of Carol Danvers&#34;mind. If permanence occurs to someone with the Transformation form, then the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s original mind is permanently destroyed.</p>",


	"mental defenses" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s mind is naturally &#34;hidden&#34;somehow, thus concealing their thoughts and true nature from all but the most powerful of mind-affecting effects. Only the most accomplished of psionicist/mentalist/mind mages are capable of breaching his mental defenses and touching his mind. When subject to a mental/mind affecting assault, the rank of XXXXcharnameXXXX Mental Defenses are subtracted from the attackers willpower before willpowers are contested.</p>",


	"Mental Invisibility" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX has the ability to render XXXXcharnameXXXX own mental energies undetectable by external means. Such means can be technological (EEG scans), psionic, Magical, or Power-based in nature. It is Invisibility in telepathic terms.
</p><p>
	The Power protects the XXXXcharnameXXXX from discovery by outside forces. It serves as Power rank Resistance to undesired probes and psionic attacks. Success means the external probe shows nothing at all, including the presence of this Power, and psionic attacks simply pass through the target (think of someone trying to punch air). The Power can e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend to other minds, but each additional mind decreases the effective Invisibility -1CS.</p>",


	"mental probe" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can telepathically probe a living mind or a psionic phenomenon to gain a detailed analysis of the target. Living minds can be searched for specific images and thoughts, although the XXXXcharnameXXXX must have a basic idea beforehand of what she is looking for. The target mind is allowed to make a Psyche FEAT to resist a Mental Probe. This is automatic, even if the target mind is initially unaware if the attempted probe. If resistance is successful, the probe is rejected with a headache- backlash that prevents the XXXXcharnameXXXX from trying to probe that target again for 24 hours. A side effect of the Power is that the target&#39;s Psyche may temporarily drop -1CS for 24 hours as a result of fending off the probe. This potential loss is determined by a second Psyche FEAT made after the initial resistance. A successful probe reveals only information known by the target.
</p><p>
	Mental Probes can be used to analyze independently existing psychic phenomena.
</p><p>
	Such things include poltergeists, psionic emissions that were so strong they permeated an area and now continually echo, and psionic Powers intercepted by the XXXXcharnameXXXX. XXXXcharnameXXXX can e XXXXcharnameXXXX amine any unknown psionic phenomena in stages. The first FEAT reveals basic information, such as the nature of the psionics in use. Further FEATs reveal increasingly detailed information.
</p><p>
	Mental Probes have a range determined by the Power rank.  maximum ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. The player has the option, when creating the XXXXcharnameXXXX, of raising the Power rank +1CS by decreasing the range to contact-only.</p>",


	"mental blast" => "<p>Call it what you like, Mental Blast, Psychic bolt, really annoying, XXXXcharnameXXXX can create bolts of pure psionic energy that can be used to directly damage a target&#39;s neural system. The Power does rank Intensity damage to the target. The  maximum ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	Targets are allowed to resist by making a Psyche FEAT. Failure means the target is knocked unconscious for 1- 10 turns, as well as taking neural damage. Targets who possess Mental or Psionic Powers can use these Powers&#34;ranks instead of the Psyche when resisting this Power.Powers like Iron Will, Mental Invisibility, Force Field Generation, Force Field vs.Psionics, and Resistance to Psionics should always bear the initial assault.The Power directly damages only neural tissue (brain tissue, nerve fibers).Damage to the rest of the body is indirect and is consistent with the seizures caused by a mangled nervous system.
</p><p>
	Note that this Power can only be used against a target that actually possesses a functioning brain. Zombies, animate matter, plants, and non-sentient Robots are immune to the Power. Player characters Robots are assumed to have a sufficiently human-like mind that they are susceptible to the Power&#39;s effects.</p>",


	"mind drain" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can deplete, negate, or even destroy a target&#39;s mental faculties. This alters the target&#39;s personality, memory, thought process (Reason and Intuition), and any Mental or Psionic Powers the target had. The target can resist by making a Psyche FEAT; success means the XXXXcharnameXXXX is repelled -by a headache-inducing backlash that prevents the XXXXcharnameXXXX from attacking that target for 24 hours. Part of the target&#39;s Psyche may be depleted by resisting the attack. If the target fails a second Psyche FEAT, then XXXXcharnameXXXX Psyche drops -1CS for 24 hours.
</p><p>
	The target&#39;s Reason and Intuition rank numbers are reduced by the Power rank number. If both are reduced to zero, the loss is permanent. If the attack is broken off before this point, the target can regain XXXXcharnameXXXX loss in the standard manner. Although such things as memory and personality are not directly tied to a number, they are still reduced by the Power. The target becomes forgetful or outright amnesiac and develops a bland personality.
</p><p>
	<em>Note:</em> XXXXcharnameXXXX does not gain the abilities XXXXcharnameXXXX denies the target.
</p><p>
	Range is determined by Power rank.  maximums ranges for attacking a single target are shown on column A of the Range Table. Each additional target decreases the range -1CS. The Power can be used repeatedly on the same target until both Reason and Intuition reach zero or until the target repels the XXXXcharnameXXXX.</p>",

</p><p>
	The Psi-Vampire or &#34;Psypire&#34;can drain the mental energy from a target by means of a Power FEAT. The intensity rank is determined by the victim&#39;s Psyche. A successful FEAT enables the Psivampire to drain an amount of energy equal to his Power rank number. This amount is drawn in equal amounts from the victim&#39;s Reason, Intuition, and whatever Mental Powers he possesses.
</p><p>
	The process can continue indefinitely, with each successful FEAT enabling the Psypire to drain more mental energy. The Psypire can drain the mental energy from a target by means of a Power FEAT. The intensity rank is determined by the victim&#39;s Psyche. A successful FEAT enables the Psivampire to drain an amount of energy equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank number. This amount is drawn in equal amounts from the victim&#39;s Reason, Intuition, and whatever Mental Powers XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses.

	The process can continue indefinitely, with each successful FEAT enabling the Psypire to drain more mental energy.
</p><p>
	The &#34;Psypire&#34;can voluntarily cease feeding at any time by making any color FEAT e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept red. A red FEAT means XXXXcharnameXXXX has entered an uncontrollable feeding frenzy that can only end when the victim is completely drained or the Psypire has. been repelled.
</p><p>
	If the Psypire fails to make a FEAT at any point in the feeding process, XXXXcharnameXXXX is instantly repulsed by the victim and can never re-establish XXXXcharnameXXXX attack.

	The Psypire distributes the gained energy among XXXXcharnameXXXX Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and whatever Powers XXXXcharnameXXXX has.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot raise this Power&#39;s rank; no Vampire of any type can ever raise their own Power rank.
</p><p>
	So why do Psypires do it? The answer is they lose energy at a frightful rate. The rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and all XXXXcharnameXXXX Powers (e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept this one) each drop one point per hour. The Psypire must feed in order to return the affected Abilities to their original ranks. This also e XXXXcharnameXXXX plains why Vampires are so rare lower ranked Vampires must constantly feed and are therefore easily detected and destroyed.
</p><p>
	If the Psypire is deprived of victims, XXXXcharnameXXXX enters a death-like trance when all XXXXcharnameXXXX afflicted Abilities drop to Shift 0. XXXXcharnameXXXX Vampiric Power continues to function and will try to feed on anything that comes in contact with the body.

The Power can also be used to e XXXXcharnameXXXX tend the range of senses not present in Normal Humans, such as senses that detect Kirlian auras or magnetic fields. The player must choose a single sense to be e XXXXcharnameXXXX tended by this Power. It must be a sense that is common to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s physical type:

		<li>The tactile form is good for identifying concealed or inaccessible shapes.</li>
		<li>examples include the interior of a lock or a non-surgical e XXXXcharnameXXXX amination of a patient.</li>
		<li>Again, a green Reason FEAT coupled with the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Talents should suffice.</li>
		<li>The range is determined by the Power rank.  maximum ranges are shown on column E of the Range Table.</li>
		<li>A drawback to this Power is that it acts as a funnel to direct Psionic attacks against the XXXXcharnameXXXX. Resistance is decreased -1CS because of this.</li>
		<li>Optional Powers include additional forms of this Power, Clairaudience, and Clairvoyance.</li>

	"Sensory Link" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can telepathically link XXXXcharnameXXXX senses with those of another being. XXXXcharnameXXXX can use the information gained from the other&#39;s senses as if it came from the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own senses. An example would be a blind man really seeing through XXXXcharnameXXXX guide dog&#39;s eyes.
</p><p>
	The Power is crucial to sense-impaired characters. Such characters need other beings with the necessary senses to replace the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s own deficiency. XXXXcharnameXXXX could receive input from any living being, including companions, adversaries, onlookers, and even animals. The range for this is line-of-sight within one area. XXXXcharnameXXXX can concentrate on the input from a single being but XXXXcharnameXXXX can also automatically scan for other possible senses"

	"Armor Skin" => "<p>This is a form of Body Armor. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s skin is transformed into a damage-resistant form. The Power rank number decreases the Intensity of any physical or energy attack. This decrease applies each turn for as long as the attack continues. The Armor Skin may be permanent or temporary. The permanent form is a lasting modification to the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s appearance and physiology. The temporary form allows the XXXXcharnameXXXX to retain XXXXcharnameXXXX normal human appearance and identity. When the need arises, the XXXXcharnameXXXX can manifest XXXXcharnameXXXX Power and transform XXXXcharnameXXXX into XXXXcharnameXXXX armored self. The advantage of the permanent form is that XXXXcharnameXXXX is always protected. The disadvantage is that the XXXXcharnameXXXX may be a physical freak. The advantage to the temporary from is that the XXXXcharnameXXXX can live a relatively normal life when XXXXcharnameXXXX is not performing XXXXcharnameXXXXic deeds. The disadvantages are two fold. One, XXXXcharnameXXXX  lacksprotective skin most of the time and two, the temporary form is only available at a cost of -2CS to the Power rank.
</p><p>
	The armor skin can take a variety of appearances. There are four main types of Armor Skin. Each has its own set of characteristics. The player must select one form when XXXXcharnameXXXX first generates this Power.

		<li><em>Leather-</em></li>

		<li><em>Leather</em> - The epidermis retains its normal shape and fle XXXXcharnameXXXX ibility but is harder to the touch. The skin maintains its normal bodily functions without the need for e XXXXcharnameXXXX tensive changes. Androids are often given this type of Armor Skin.</li>
		<li><em>Rigid plates</em> - The body is covered in interlinked plates like an insect&#39;s chitin or an armadillo&#39;s shell. The wrestler known as the Armadillo is an example of this type of Armor Skin.</li>
		<li><em>Visually Inorganic</em> - The body can be any shape but has the appearance of nonorganic matter. The layering may appear rocky, metallic, or any other choice of surface. The Thing&#39;s orange rock-like e XXXXcharnameXXXX terior is an example of this.</li>
		<li><em>Non-organic</em> - The body actually is covered in inorganic material. Unlike an externally applied coating, this one is formed by modified cells in the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s epidermis.</li>

However, the tissue of capable of withstanding major damage without showing any effects. The resistance covers physical and energy attacks only. The Intensity rank number of the attack is reduced by this Power&#39;s rank number. The remaining Intensity is the actual damage the XXXXcharnameXXXX suffers. While the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s skin shows the effects of the tremendous abuse it suffers, at least it heals quickly. The Power enables the epidermis to heal at a tenfold rate.</p>",


	"chemical touch" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body secretes chemicals that are capable of a variety of effects on a target. The chemicals can be automatically or consciously secreted. The player must choose when the Power is first generated; there is an equal random chance for each. If the XXXXcharnameXXXX possesses a variety of Touch Powers, then the XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the nature of the secreted chemicals at will. A Power Touch is created by combining this Power with any other Power the XXXXcharnameXXXX has. Each Touch Power has Power rank Intensity and does rank damage, regardless of the Touch Power&#39;s nature. The behavioral characteristics are those of the original Power that was incorporated into the Touch Power. The range is always limited to Contact only. A wide variety of Touch Powers are possible, as this Power can combine with most of the other entries in this book. The key to it is playability; if you can figure out a rational e XXXXcharnameXXXX planation for a given combination, the you should try it.
</p><p>
	This can generate a myriad of unique Powers. Some possibilities include
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Hallucinogenic -</em> The touch incorporates Hallucinations to produce vivid but totally false images in the target&#39;s mind. Fighting and Intuition drop -3CS.</li>
		<li><em>Bioluminescence -</em> The Touch incorporates Light Generation to make the target&#39;s body temporarily self illuminating.</li>
		<li><em>Napalm Grip -</em> The Touch incorporates Fire Generation to create fire on contact.</li>

	"body transformation (Mist)" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can alter the nature of elements and compounds within XXXXcharnameXXXX own body so as to become a sentient &#34;mist&#34;cloud without any solid (or even liquid) components above the microscopic level. Innate safeguards of this ability maintain the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s lifeforce in their altered mist-like state.

	"hyper-leaping" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can jump great distances. By repeated leaps, XXXXcharnameXXXX can rapidly cover large distances. The distance XXXXcharnameXXXX can cover is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Strength rank +1 rank. If a lower rank is initially rolled, it must be raised to this level. This is the distances XXXXcharnameXXXX can safely leap. Innate safeguards in this Power enable XXXXcharnameXXXX to safely land so as not to injure or break a leg for example. The effect is the same on XXXXcharnameXXXX as if he were a Normal Human making a 2 foot leap up or across or descending 3 feet.
</p><p>
	The effects on the area XXXXcharnameXXXX lands on might not be the same as if a normal jump occurred. Consider that the Hulk splinters the pavement when he lands. To determine what sort of effects occur when XXXXcharnameXXXX lands, it is with a force equal to that of five times XXXXcharnameXXXX own weight suddenly drops on the surface in question. The actual landspeed varies with the angle of the leaps.
</p><p>
	Physical burdens do not decrease XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s speed, although they might decrease XXXXcharnameXXXX control. Anything XXXXcharnameXXXX is carrying is also protected by the innate safeguards against damage; XXXXcharnameXXXX acts as a shock-absorber.</p>",


	"hyper-speed" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can run at Power rank speed for e XXXXcharnameXXXX tended amounts of time. The Power has the side-effect of raising the Ability rank number of Endurance by this Power&#39;s rank number. It includes protection to wind resistance and windburn; this protection e XXXXcharnameXXXX tends to anything XXXXcharnameXXXX is carrying. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s lungs are modified to breath high velocity air. The last benefit can be crucial if XXXXcharnameXXXX is capable of Remarkable speeds or better. If XXXXcharnameXXXX stumbles, he continues on a ballistic trajectory until he regains XXXXcharnameXXXX footing or rolls to a halt. To cut down on the chance of this, the Power increase XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s reaction time to be able cope with impending problems. The increased reaction time decreases the relative speed of any other moving object. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank number decreases the perceived speed of the other object. For example, Quicksilver&#39;s Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX speed lets him/hers perceive a bullet traveling at 600 mph as if it were traveling only 15 mph. This side-effect enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to dodge or even catch things like bullets and missiles.</p>",


	"hyper-strength" => "<p>This is the iconic super power of a meta being, representing not only XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s raw physical force, but also it is the physical manifestation of XXXXcharnameXXXX ability to assert himself over another. As such, XXXXcharnameXXXX is capable of bench pressing a  maximum of weight, or to put it another way, XXXXcharnameXXXX could bench the Weight example.</p>",


	"invulnerability" => "<p>This represents the ultimate combination of Resistances and Body Armor. Eagle is immune to any physical harm, equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX power rank&#39;s limit. The immunity includes the following resistances: fire, heat, cold, electricity, radiation, corrosives, disease, poison, brute force, sonics, and kinetic bolts. The rank of the Invulnerability reduces the rank of the attack form. Thus if he were struck with an attack value of 15, XXXXcharnameXXXX invulnerability rank of 12 would reduce the damage done to XXXXcharnameXXXX by XXXXcharnameXXXX rank of 12, thus he would only suffer an attack of 3 points to XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Body.</p>",


	"Immortal" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX ages at an every slowing rate. By the time turns one hundred will appear to be about 21 or 22. By the time reaches 25 will no longer age at all and will be unable to die e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept by violent means such as crushing XXXXcharnameXXXX or cutting his head off or doing anything else that would effectively destroy his body in one shot would more than likely kill XXXXcharnameXXXX.</p>",


	"Self-Sustance" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can survive indefinitely without consuming air, water, or food. Bodily wastes are internally recycled back into useable materials. Normally XXXXcharnameXXXX would not need to replenish himself when XXXXcharnameXXXX power reached its limit. merely resumes normal consumption habits (breathe normally, eat a light snack, etc.). This is the permanent form of the power. The temporary form requires XXXXcharnameXXXX to consume mass quantities at the e XXXXcharnameXXXX piration of the Power. (&#34;That&#39;s the fifteenth steak you&#34;ve eaten, Fred. How long did you say it&#39;s been since you ate last?&#34;) The required intake is one-quarter what XXXXcharnameXXXX would normally have consumed during the time he was abstaining. XXXXcharnameXXXX can raise XXXXcharnameXXXX Power rank +1rs by opting for the temporary form.</p>",


	"serial immortality" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can suffer damage, get sick, age, and even die. None of it is permanent to them, though. When XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s body dies from any cause, the unique nature of XXXXcharnameXXXX life-force enables it to transfer to a new body. can also transfer some but not all of XXXXcharnameXXXX Powers to the new body. XXXXcharnameXXXX loses all Karma with the death of the old body. There are five forms of Serial Immortality, each with a different means of rebirth and Power transferral. Their are five methods from which a character may select:
		 <br /><br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Newborn -</em> The body is that of an infant. XXXXcharnameXXXX can enter the body at any point from conception to birth. XXXXcharnameXXXX is helpless until birth actually occurs. XXXXcharnameXXXX can accelerate the body&#39;s physical development in order to induce birth and quickly regain physical maturity. The rate of accelerated development is a multiplier equal to the Power rank number. A power rank of &#34;2&#34;would age the character twice as fast as normal until they reached their physical prime, a &#34;10&#34;rank would age them ten times faster then normal until they reached their physical prime. <br >
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mental Powers are immediately transferred to the new body. Physical Powers are regained as the body matures. The game moderator can decide how and when the Powers reappear. Powers that are derived externally or result from massive alterations of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s original form are not transferred. XXXXcharnameXXXX will have to recover or recreate the source of these Powers in order to regain them.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Premade -</em> The new body is a previously prepared clone or android body that was prepared specifically for this purpose. Such a body is already physically mature and in possession of the full range of the XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Powers. It is completely mindless and rests in a comatose state until activated by &#39;s life-force. The knowledge of how to create these bodies can be learned if the has the appropriate stats, skills and resources. If a premade body is unavailable at the time the old one dies, the life-force drifts in Limbo until such a body becomes available.</li>
		<li>
			<em> Re-animation -</em> The life-force enters and revives a recently deceased but unmutilated corpse, preferably of the same species as the original body. The body must be reasonably intact, although the Power does include a single-use form of regeneration that repairs the body/restarts bodily functions. His/Her can not control which body enters but rather is drawn to one in the following order of preference: 1) closest to old body, 2) most recently dead, and 3) least severe damage.

			Mental Powers are immediately transferred. Most physical Powers are regained as XXXXcharnameXXXX Re shapes the new body to accommodate the Powers&#34;use. Powers that are external must be recovered or recreated. The amount of time needed to reshape the body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number. If the corpse has intrinsic Powers, XXXXcharnameXXXX gains the use of these upon re-animating the corpse. Such Powers are not transferred to subsequent bodies. The re animated body regains full life within a day of the Power&#39;s use.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Spontaneous Creation -</em> This is the most sociably acceptable form of Serial Immortality. XXXXcharnameXXXX creates existing matter and energy into the flesh of a new body. The newly-created body is identical to the previous one and possesses all Powers e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept externally derived ones. Any Power that is in XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s self- image can transfer. The time needed to create a new body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Parasite -</em> This is the nastiest, least socially acceptable form of Serial Immortal ity. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s life- force invades a living, physically mature body and overwhelms the original occupant&#39;s mind. Successful invasion is determined by pitting the Power rank against the would- be victim&#39;s Psyche. The invader must have a willpower greater then that of the subject being invaded. Failure means the invader must choose another victim. If the invasion succeeds, the original mind suffers one of five possible fates; the player must choose one that holds for all victims of this Power. There is an equal random chance for each.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<em>Subordination -</em> The victim retains consciousness and individuality but loses all physical control. XXXXcharnameXXXX is a prisoner in XXXXcharnameXXXX own body.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Merger -</em> The victim&#39;s mind is incorporated into the greater mind of the invader. Comatose: The victim&#39;s mind is rendered unconscious for the duration of the invasion.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Obliteration -</em> The victim&#39;s mind is completely destroyed.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Eviction -</em> The victim&#39;s mind is driven out of XXXXcharnameXXXX body and becomes a Free Spirit (see Free Spirit).</li>

	If a Replicant is killed, XXXXcharnameXXXX doesn&#34;t lose any Body, though XXXXcharnameXXXX might psychic trauma from the Replicants death situation. Replicants can last for up 72 hours before needing to return to the original host. If the Replicants fail to return to the host within that period they will be unable to rejoin with the whole and become telepathically severed from all other replicants/host. Triad can create two additional replicants.</p>",


	"shape-shifting (Self)" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can drastically alter all of XXXXcharnameXXXX physical parameters (dimensions, appearance, physiology) to achieve any desired shape. Despite appearances, the XXXXcharnameXXXX retains his basic chemical composition unless other Powers are used simultaneously, such as Body Transformation-Self. example: Chameleon Chief of the Legion of Super Villains transforms himself into a stone wall. Despite its granite-like facade, it&#39;s composed of flesh; instead of chips flying when the wall is attacked, it bleeds.
</p><p>
	 XXXXcharnameXXXX can attempt to change into any form; success is determined by detail of the written description (Mod call for contested results).
</p><p>
	Normal duration is determined by Power rank. If XXXXcharnameXXXX attempts a shape that e XXXXcharnameXXXX ceeds XXXXcharnameXXXX normal size limits (i.e. not more that 150% nor less than 50% of his original size), this affects the duration, dropping it the equivalent of -3RS. This way XXXXcharnameXXXX can attempt to impersonate a fly or a dinosaur; he just can&#34;t do it for long.</p>",


	"triplication (self)" => "<p>A limited form of Self-Replication, XXXXcharnameXXXX can spontaneously split herself into three e XXXXcharnameXXXX act copies of XXXXcharnameXXXX. The new bodies are, while semi-independent are identical to the original form which they split in every way and manner; each possessing an independent mind but all are linked telepathically so three bodies are aware of each other&#39;s actions and can work in unison. Each Replicant possesses the same skills, powers and abilities as the original, e XXXXcharnameXXXX cept for the ability to replicate further (that is, no Replicant could generate more Replicants)."

$aarPowTravel = [
	"flight" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can fly through air and space without an apparent means of propulsion. This is the most desired Power in the history of the world. The Power rank determines the  maximum speed XXXXcharnameXXXX can attain in a specific condition. There are three mediums in which they can fly. The slowest form of Flight occurs when XXXXcharnameXXXX torpedoes through the water at the Water Movement rate (-4R). Faster speed occurs when XXXXcharnameXXXX flies through the air at the Air Movement rate. The fastest flight occurs when XXXXcharnameXXXX is free of any hindering atmospheric friction; this is the Space Movement rate (+4R). XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s maneuverability is determined by his Agility. XXXXcharnameXXXX may be able to surpass light speed but if he has Feeble Agility he is going to need a wide turning radius. True Flight includes as a side effect Power rank resistance to atmospheric friction and lungs adapted to breathe high velocity wind. It does not include the ability to breathe water or survive the rigors of outer space. When creating XXXXcharnameXXXX. the player can define the Power in any way that is consistent with the character or his equipment.</p>",


	"hyper-digging" => "<p>While burrowing is not XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s preferred mode of transportation, when compared to running or flying, he is still capable of travelling swiftly through earth and rock by burrowing a tunnel at Power rank speed (land movement rate). Normally any tunnels burrowed by him/hers collapse within a few minutes of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s passaging. The exceptionis the tunnel within 10 feet of XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s current location. This allows him/hers to occasionally stop. A tunnel never collapses on him/hers. unless a higher Intensity force is applied. Note that a side-effect Hyper-Digging is that when digging XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Strength and Endurance are increased as needed that he will not tire.</p>",


	"hyper-leaping" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can jump great distances. By repeated leaps, XXXXcharnameXXXX can rapidly cover large distances. The distance XXXXcharnameXXXX can cover is equal to XXXXcharnameXXXX Strength rank +1 rank. If a lower rank is initially rolled, it must be raised to this level. This is the distances XXXXcharnameXXXX can safely leap. Innate safeguards in this Power enable XXXXcharnameXXXX to safely land so as not to injure or break a leg for example. The effect is the same on XXXXcharnameXXXX as if he were a Normal Human making a 2 foot leap up or across or descending 3 feet.
</p><p>
	The effects on the area XXXXcharnameXXXX lands on might not be the same as if a normal jump occurred. Consider that the Hulk splinters the pavement when he lands. To determine what sort of effects occur when XXXXcharnameXXXX lands, it is with a force equal to that of five times XXXXcharnameXXXX own weight suddenly drops on the surface in question. The actual landspeed varies with the angle of the leaps.
</p><p>
	Physical burdens do not decrease XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s speed, although they might decrease XXXXcharnameXXXX control. Anything XXXXcharnameXXXX is carrying is also protected by the innate safeguards against damage; XXXXcharnameXXXX acts as a shock-absorber.</p>",


	"hyper-speed" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can run at Power rank speed for e XXXXcharnameXXXX tended amounts of time. The Power has the side-effect of raising the Ability rank number of Endurance by this Power&#39;s rank number. It includes protection to wind resistance and windburn; this protection e XXXXcharnameXXXX tends to anything XXXXcharnameXXXX is carrying. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s lungs are modified to breath high velocity air. The last benefit can be crucial if XXXXcharnameXXXX is capable of Remarkable speeds or better.
</p><p>
	If XXXXcharnameXXXX stumbles, he continues on a ballistic trajectory until he regains XXXXcharnameXXXX footing or rolls to a halt. To cut down on the chance of this, the Power increase XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s reaction time to be able cope with impending problems. The increased reaction time decreases the relative speed of any other moving object. XXXXcharnameXXXX&#39;s Power rank number decreases the perceived speed of the other object. For example, Quicksilver&#39;s Shift XXXXcharnameXXXX speed lets him/hers perceive a bullet traveling at 600 mph as if it were traveling only 15 mph. This side-effect enables XXXXcharnameXXXX to dodge or even catch things like bullets and missiles.</p>",


	"spacial rift" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can create an actual worm hole which near instantly transports anything which passes through the spacial opening or a rift to be transposed to where the otherside of the rift has been positioned. The location of where a rift opens and closes is determined by the XXXXcharnameXXXX. the distance which such a spacial rift can cover is determined by their Power Rank. Anything, regarless if it&#39;s a person, a lazer beam or a rock which passes through the rift instantly vanishes from where it was and instantly reappears as stated where the otherside of the rift opens too. Objects do not physically cross the intervening distance and are not affected by any physical barriers. Because this ability acts like a wormhole, objects can not materialize within another object. The discs are two-way meaning that people/objects can travel from one point to another from either side of the portal.</p>",


	"teleportation" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can vanish from one location and instantly reappear in another distant site as far as a quarter of a mile from where she originally was. She does not physically cross the intervening distance and is not affected by any physical barriers. As she re-materializes, natural safeguards of this ability automatically dispel any gases and liquids aside before she actually solidifies. Normal safeguards prevent the XXXXcharnameXXXX from consciously Teleporting into a solid mass.</p>",


	"time travel" => "<p>XXXXcharnameXXXX can travel in time to reach any point in the past, present or future. The  maximum range XXXXcharnameXXXX can reach varies depending on which direction they are traveling. Travel into the past is easier because it already exists from the their point of view. The  maximum range is equal to the Power rank number times 1000 years. Travel into the future is harder (at least, if you&#39;re planning a return trip). The  maximum range into the future is equal to the Power rank number times 10 years. ( + XXXXcharnameXXXX to initiative).</p>",


	"wall crawling" => "<p>Due to some truely remarkable bodily adpations, XXXXcharnameXXXX is capable of crawling up any surface regardless of how sheer it is. XXXXcharnameXXXX can even hang, suspended from the ceiling providing that it is capable of baring his weight. XXXXcharnameXXXX is able to due this because of the millions of microscoptic satae which cover XXXXcharnameXXXX toes. With the invisible aid of these amazingly powerful microscopic grippers, there is almost no surface XXXXcharnameXXXX cannot adhere to. The setae on XXXXcharnameXXXX feet are self-cleaning and will usually remove any clogging dirt which might interfer with his clinging and climbing abilities within a few steps.</p>",


	"Webcasting"=> "XXXXcharnameXXXX can generate and shot out a solid web-like substance. The web can hit any target within 100 feet, instantly adhering to it and binding it. The Web has some basic properties. It can ensnare anyone within the target site. It possesses a material strength equal to the powers rank upon instantly hardening after being fired. It can be used to form swing-lines that enable XXXXcharnameXXXX to travel great distances in a single swing, and it can also make a shield with a material strength equal to that of the contested power rank."
