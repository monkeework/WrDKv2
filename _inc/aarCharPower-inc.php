	"body armor (artificial)" => "<p>XcharnameX possesses artificially-created armor that provides protection and possibly a way of possessing other Powers. Armor comes in many forms of exotic plate-mail, nuclear-powered exoskeletons, or mechanically-created force fields.</p>

	<p>NOTE: The player should work with the members of staff to create armor which properly represents your character, and fits the look and feel of the site. The player can also determine which Powers are possessed by XcharnameX and which are properties of the armor. Any powers built into the armor can later be modified and enhanced; think of the changes Tony Stark has made iover the years to the Iron Man armor. On the other hand, powers that are built into the armor may possibly suffer from mechanical failure. The Armor' Power rank determines its durability and ability to resist/reduce damage.</p>",


	"force field" => "<p>XcharnameX possesses the ability to generate a protective barrier around XgenderXself which is proof against a wide variety of forces, including brute force, energy attacks and extreme temperature conditions. It can be projected and or used for a variety of feats.</p>

	<p>The force field completely absorbs any and all damage which might be caused by attack which is equal to or less in Intensity than that of their fields Power Rank. If The Intensity of the attack is higher than that of the field, then the attack is reduced by the fields power rank. The remaining Intensity breaches the field and affects anyone within by This diminished effect.</p>",


	"reflection" => "<p>XcharnameX can turn any attack sent against Xhim-her-themX back onto the attacker. The attack may be of any nature: brute force, Power, or even magic. The Power absorbs the energy of the attack equal to or less then it' intensity rank and redirects it back at  XcharnameX would attacker. If the attack' Intensity is higher than that of XcharnameX' reflection power rank, some of the damage will passes through and affect  XcharnameX.  XcharnameX can use Reflection indefinitely, so long as it isn&#039;t overcome by superior force. After The first time  XcharnameX' reflection is breached, it becomes inactive for one hour for each rank of intensitity the assaulting for was then that of the reflection</p>",


	"resistance (emotion attacks)" => "<p>XcharnameX has increased resistance to emotion-based attacks. Such attacks include Emotion Control, Hallucinations, Domination, and attacks aimed at their Intuition.  XcharnameX can ignore attacks with Intensities less than that of their power rank/willpower (depending on which is greater), and may reduce damage from higher level attacks by  XcharnameX' resistance.</p>",


	"resistance (energy attacks)" => "<p>XcharnameX has an increased resistance to any energy broadcast against them, whether artificial, natural, or Power-based. Such attacks include Light, Heat, Flame, Plasma, Hard radiation, Electricity, Vibration, Sonics, Cold, and Kinetic Bolts (most of the Energy Emission category).  XcharnameX can ignore attacks with Intensities less than  XcharnameX Power rank and may reduce higher level attacks by  XcharnameX own Power Rank.</p>",

	"resistance (mental attacks)" => "<p>XcharnameX has increased resistance to psychic assualts and attacks aimed at  XcharnameX mind and/or neural system. Such attacks include psionics, neural manipulation, and any other attacks aimed at the mind or they&#039;re willpower.

	"resistance (physical attack)" => "<p>XcharnameX has an increased resistance to any physical attack (blunt or kinetic). This includes brute force, chemical weapons, biochemicals, disease, hostile environments, and temperature extremes. The XcharnameX can ignore any physical attacks with Intensities less than that of the Power rank, and may reduce damage from higher level attacks by XcharnameX own Power Rank.  XcharnameX can ignore attacks with Intensities less than XcharnameX Power rank and may reduce higher level attacks by  XcharnameX' own Power Rank.</p>",


	"resistance (power manipulation)" => "<p>XcharnameX has increased resistance to attacks that directly affect XcharnameX Powers. Such attacks include Weakness Creation, Power Control, Power Domination, Magic Control, and Magical Domination.</p>

XcharnameX can ignore any vampiric attack whose rank is less than this Power' rank. XcharnameX can reduce The effectiveness of the vampire' attack by deducting  XcharnameX Power Rank from the vampiric attack' Power rank.

Because of this,  XcharnameX is not reliance on  XcharnameX eyes for perceiving their surroundings. Thus, it is enarly impossible to blindside or to sneak up on  XcharnameX. as they have in effect a 360 degree field of &#34;vision&#34;.  XcharnameX is immune to the effects of invisibility and darkness unless such effects directly effect the mind.</p>",


	"abnormal sensitivity" => "<p>XcharnameX' senses function in their normal manner but their normal range of sensitivity is altered. The senses detect what they normally cannot and cannot detect what they normally can.</p>

	<p>This affects either vision or hearing. the former case,  XcharnameX sees infrared and ultraviolet light, radio waves, and radiation. In the latter case,  XcharnameX hears e  XcharnameX tremely high and low pitches.</p>

	<p>This may be considered a handicap human characters while for aliens this could be a fact of life. A XcharnameX can turn it into an advantage by devising a mean.of negating the senses of his adversary that doesn&#039;t hinder his own altered senses.</p>",


	"circular vision (360)" => "<p>XcharnameX can see 360 degrees around  XcharnameX.</p>",


	"danger sense" => "<p>XcharnameX can sense moments before a dangerous situation is about to occur, and usually from what direction such danger will emminate. Simply put, sense danger notifies  XcharnameX when they are about to be endangered. It is a limited form of Precognition. This power is often given different names, and like most mental powers, varies greatly from person to person. Spider -</strong>Man' danger sense is called his 'pider -</strong>sense&#039;, and alerts him when danger is near, though he does not always know the specifics of the danger. Additionally, this sense may warn when others are lying to them if such lies would endanger the  XcharnameX.</p>",


	"detection (biological life)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and identify biological, genetic and/or related phenomena.  XcharnameX can detect and discern the differences between both comple  XcharnameX and simple life forms. As such, they can sense the difference between human and an anemba, a cat and a dog or a human and a mutant.  XcharnameX can identify the those they&#039;ve met before; identify the specific persons with an Amazing rank; and on an Unearthly FEAT, provided  XcharnameX knows of the user,  XcharnameX can identify the actual possessor of the psionic power.</p>",


	"detection (energy)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and identify energy and related phenomena.  XcharnameX can only detect actual energy, not potential energy (it couldn&#039;t detect a bomb until it e  XcharnameX plodes, for example). Likewise, while it can detect the energies consciously emitted by superhumans, it cannot detect the super humans themselves.</p>",


	"detection (extra dimensional)" => "<p>XcharnameX can sense across dimensional barriers and see things existing in other dimensions. These include Asgard, the Astral Plane, Avalon, the Dark Dimension, the Demon Dimension, etc. The power rank number equals the number of different dimensions into which  XcharnameX can see.</p>",


	"detection (magic)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and identify magic and its effects.  XcharnameX can detect both magic in actual use and in potential. As such, this is another way to detect mutants, although it cannot differentiate them from normal magic-users.  XcharnameX can identify the past use of magic, identifys the caster if familiar to them, and in some instances identify the actual spell.</p>",


	"detection (power)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and identify superhuman Powers and can function as &#34;Mutant Detection.&#34; XcharnameX can also identify specific superhumans by their characteristic Powers (an Unearthly FEAT).  XcharnameX can identify the presence of previously invoked power when e  XcharnameX amining former targets of Power of a Good Intensity or greater within there sphere of detection.</p>",


	"detection (psionic)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and identify psionic Power and related phenomena. It can detect both actual psionics and the potential to use them. As such, this is the last way to detect mutants.  XcharnameX can identify the past use of psionics on a living subject on an E  XcharnameX cellent Intensity FEAT; identify the specific psionic Power on an Amazing Intensity FEAT; and on an Unearthly FEAT, provided  XcharnameX knows of the user,  XcharnameX can identify the actual possessor of the psionic power.</p>",


	"detection (weakness)" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect flaws and stress points in a target. This doesn&#039;t guarantee  XcharnameX can exploit this knowledge, though. The rank determines the types of weaknesses  XcharnameX can sense.</p>",


	"dimensional vision" => "<p>XcharnameX can sense across the dimensional barrier and see things existing in other dimensions and/or vibratory planes</p>",


	"Elemental Sense" => "<p>XcharnameX can immediately identify the elemental compostion and structure of an object and determine structural weaknesses (if any) on contact with the object. This is a subconscious, intuitive.</p>",


	"hyper-hearing" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect e  XcharnameX tremely faint sounds and unusual frequencies.  XcharnameX can identify objects by the sounds they emit. Because of the sensitivity of  XcharnameX hearing,  XcharnameX is more vulnerable to sonic attacks (which receive a +1RS against  XcharnameX.</p>",


	"hyper-olfactory" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect the presence of minute traces of substances and accurately identify them by smell. This Power is continually functioning</p>",


	"hyper-taste" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect the presence of minute traces of substances and accurately identify them by taste. This Power is continually functioning;  XcharnameX has learned to ignore unpleasant smells. If he loses  XcharnameX ability to mask out nasty odors, he&#039;ll be so distracted (and possibly sickened) by the intruding odors that he loses 1 endurance rank per day the condition persists</p>",


	"hyper-touch" => "<p>XcharnameX possesses an Enhanced sense of touch that permits  XcharnameX to detect e  XcharnameX tremely fine surface details and to identify materials by their surface &#34;feel.&#34;</p>",


	"microscopic vision" => "<p>XcharnameX' eyes can focus on e  XcharnameX tremely minute targets, objects too small for normal vision to perceive. This Power functions in two stages. The first is light magnification;  XcharnameX' eyes function as normal microscopes. This allows  XcharnameX to see things as small as chromosomes. Beyond this level, light no longer carries information. The second stage of this Power is a variation of Clairvoyance that permits  XcharnameX to see miniature, rather than distant, targets</p>",


	"radar sense" => "<p>XcharnameX can gain a three -</strong>dimensional picture of his surroundings through the use of electromagnetic waves.  XcharnameX both emits and senses these waves.  XcharnameX can use the Power to locate and identify targets by their characteristic echoes.</p>
		<br>
	Because of  XcharnameX' sensitivity to electromagnetic waves,  XcharnameX has an increased vulnerability to electrical and magnetic attacks; these may temporarily negate Radarsense.</p>",


	"shadow sight" => "<p>Unlike most people who walk the Earth,  XcharnameX is at home in the shadows. As such  XcharnameX is not hindered by the absence of light as others might be and can see perfectly well regardless of how dark it is, natural or otherwise.</p>",


	"sonar" => "<p>XcharnameX can gain a three-dimensional picture of his environment through the use of soundwaves. The Power allows  XcharnameX to locate and identify targets by the way they reflect sound.
</p><p>
	There are two ways this Power can operate. Passive Sonar utilizes existing sound. Active Sonar uses special sounds emitted by  XcharnameX (this is how bats and dolphins do it). The latter form requires a special adaptation of  XcharnameX' voice; otherwise there is no real difference between them. Because of the special sensitivity of  XcharnameX' hearing,  XcharnameX is vulnerable to sonic attacks.</p>",


	"temporal sensitivity" => "<p>XcharnameX' physical senses function in such a way as to be able to &#039;perceive&#039; actions and events regardless of the rate, speed, or temporal factor in which such events might unfold. Likewise  XcharnameX physical senses can now sense/detect when extra-ordinary temporal events are occurring. This sensitivity may allow  XcharnameX a limited amount of post/precognitive abilities.</p>",


	"telescopic vision" => "<p>XcharnameX' eyes can focus on e  XcharnameX tremely distant targets, objects too far away for the unaided eye to perceive.  XcharnameX eyes function as normal binoculars. This allows  XcharnameX to see things regardless of distant so long as they aren&#039;t obstructed by the curvature of the planet, light pollution, etc.</p>",


	"thermal vision" => "<p>XcharnameX can see infrared light and heat images. This allows  XcharnameX to see in the dark, perceive temperature differences (especially those left by a living person' contact with an object), and partially see through solids. In the last case,  XcharnameX can only see the heat patterns of objects touching the other side of the barrier.  XcharnameX can judge the temperature of a target by its thermal color.  XcharnameX has an increased risk of being blinded by strong heat sources, even those that don&#039;t affect normal vision (-1R). Thermal vision may be a consciously-activated mode or the XcharnameX' normal means of vision.</p>",


	"tracking" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and follow the tracks left by a specific target.  XcharnameX can detect environmental and spatial disturbances with the result that at high ranks  XcharnameX can actually track across deep space.</p>",


	"True Sight" => "<p>XcharnameX can see the correct image of a target, despite any attempts at concealment or disguise it. This Power can penetrate any means of hiding something' true nature, whether physical, psionic, illusionary, or power-based. True Sight can penetrate any disguise at or below its rank. Range is limited to one area unless the Power is coupled with a Power that e  XcharnameX tends his vision (Telescopic Vision, for example). The Power may be automatic or deliberate.</p>",


	"ultraviolet vision" => "<p>XcharnameX can see ultraviolet light. Because UV light isn&#039;t as readily absorbed by water as normal light, this Power enables  XcharnameX to see clearly through fog and at greater distance in the water (+1rs).  XcharnameX can also see the dim light given off by radioactive materials.  XcharnameX cannot actually &#34;see in the dark&#34;but only if UV light is present. The effect is the same when seen by normal people.  XcharnameX has an increased risk of being blinded by strong UV sources, like black lights and radiation.</p>",


	"x-ray vision" => "<p>This is commonly called &#34;x-ray vision&#34; but is not actually based on the emission of x-rays.  XcharnameX can see through any solid with the exception of lead; the effect is as if the obscuring material were transformed to clear glass. If this Power is interfered with by outside forces,  XcharnameX may perceives everything as a transparent outline."

$aarPowEnergyControl = [
	"catalytic control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control the speed at which chemical reactions occur. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the energies emitted or drained in such reactions by XcharnameX Power rank number. For example, XcharnameX could increase the heat, emitted by exothermic reactions like oxidation; XcharnameX could also increase the chilling effect of endothermic reactions. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the speed or rate at which reactions occur, like stopping iron from dissolving in acid or causing steel to rapidly transform into rust. XcharnameX can also develop a variety of Power stunts:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Causing chemical reactions that are normally impossible, such as anything involving inert gases.</li>
			<li>Knocking out self-powered machinery by stopping the reactions that generate their power.</li>
			<li>Inducing suspended animation in a living target by stopping all biochemical activity, especially decay.</li>
			<li>Incapacitating living targets by inducing nausea.</li>
			<li>Increasing XcharnameX' Strength and Endurance by increasing the metabolizing of o XcharnameX ygen and food (or whatever the body uses).</li>
			<li>Collapsing a target by hastening the forces of decay.</li>
			<li>Forming compounds by simply mi XcharnameX ing materials together and not needing heat or special conditions.</li>
			<li>Baking without an oven.</li>
		</ul>
</p><p>
	The Power can continually affect a target as long as it functions. Any results are permanent if they do not involve a living subject. Effects on a living subject cease within one minute after the Power ceases.</p>",


	"coldshaping" => "<p>XcharnameX can control any force that actively decreases the temperature of something else. This can be used to increase or decrease the Cold' Intensity by this Power' rank number. This function overlaps both Heat and Cold Generation but differs in that this Power cannot alter the natural temperature of a target or alter local temperatures to suit XcharnameX' whims.<br >
	There are two primary functions to this Power. The first is to counteract or supplement cold-based Powers. XcharnameX can alter such Powers as soon as they are emitted from the target' body. Such powers can be increased or decreased by this Power' rank number. XcharnameX can also redirect such Powers. This leads to the second primary function.<br >
	 XcharnameX can shape fields of intense cold and produce useful results. Ice Generation is a form of this Power. XcharnameX can create shapes of rapidly-formed ice that XcharnameX can use in a variety of Power stunts. XcharnameX can also develop variations on Ice Generation that use other materials present in XcharnameX local atmosphere. Such substances include carbon dio XcharnameX ide (even more slippery than ice, and the fog can knock people out), nitrogen, o XcharnameX ygen (potentially dangerous since a concentration of it can make normal flames e XcharnameX plode), and the inert gases (an Amazing FEAT, since there are so few of these present in Earth' atmosphere-but on other planets, not so tough).</p>",


	"darkforce manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can generate and control the extra-dimensional energy-form known as &#34;Darkforce.&#34;This resembles a tangible, impenetrable shadow and possesses several unique characteristics that XcharnameX can use to develop Power Stunts:
</p><p>
		<ul>
			<li>Blunt attack damage at Power rank.</li>
			<li>Shadowcasting of Power rank Intensity darkness over a  maximum of three areas.</li>
			<li>Flight at -1CS speed.</li>
			<li>Gateway.</li>
			<li>Energy Solidification.</li>
		</ul>
</p><p>
	The Darkforce is as yet undefined in the Marvel Universe. For your game' purposes, you might simply treat it as an other-dimensional power source that fills its own entire pocket dimension. That definition will work in or out of the official Marvel Universe.</p>",


	"electrical manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create electrical streams that can do Rank damage. XcharnameX can project the electricity through any conductive medium, such as air, water, or metal, at Power rank range. If the player chooses, XcharnameX can gain +2RS to his damage by choosing to limit his range to contact only. In this case, the range can be e XcharnameX tended by conducting the Power through solid conductors like metal. Electricity comes in various forms:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Static electricity causes magnetic attraction between objects and can disrupt electronic communications.</li>
			<li>Lightning is sheer, raw, destructive power and by far the most popular form of this Power.</li>
			<li>Alternating current is what our technology is driven by. This Power can either energize or overload normal electrical devices.</li>
			<li>Direct current is what a battery produces. It can energize or overload devices that use DC power. It can also short out devices that use AC power.</li>
		</ul>
	<p><em>Note:</em> This power will not work without an atmosphere to conduct the current.</p>",


	"energy absorption" => "<p>XcharnameX can absorb any form of energy, whether natural or Power-based, and not suffer any damage. XcharnameX can absorb energy equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. This stored energy can be released at any time he desires; upon release it has a lower Intensity than its original state (-2 Ranks). XcharnameX may also choose to harmlessly dissipate the energy over a long period; this is a number of minutes times ten equal to the Intensity (rank number) of the absorbed energy.
</p><p>
	When XcharnameX releases XcharnameX limit, three things can happen. One, he simply cannot absorb any more energy until he releases what he has already absorbed. This assumes that he is in control of the situation and has a choice in XcharnameX actions. The second possibility is that a &#34;gag refle XcharnameX &#34;takes effect. Just as a human e XcharnameX pels all food when the intake limit is reached, so too will the XcharnameX simply, uncontrollably release all absorbed energy at once. The third possibility is dangerous for the XcharnameX. If he attempts to absorb more than XcharnameX limit, he may suffer physical damage. All absorbed energy is released in a single post, doing full damage to the XcharnameX.</p>",


	"Energy Sponge" => "<p>XcharnameX can absorb any form of energy, whether natural or Power-based, and not suffer any damage. XcharnameX can absorb energy equal to XcharnameX Power Rank Number.
</p><p>
	This stored energy can be released at any time XcharnameX desires; upon release it has a lower Intensity than its original state (-2CS). XcharnameX may also choose to harmlessly dissipate the energy over a long period; this is a number of turns equal to the Intensity rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, your XcharnameX soaks up an Incredible radiation blast. XcharnameX chooses to re-release it later as a single, E XcharnameX cellent Intensity blast that could really muck up whatever it hit, or XcharnameX could let the radiation slowly seep away (this takes 40 turns, or four minutes). When XcharnameX releases XcharnameX limit, three things can happen. One, XcharnameX simply cannot absorb any more energy until XcharnameX releases what XcharnameX has already soaked up. This assumes XcharnameX is in control of the situation and has a choice in XcharnameX actions.
</p><p>
	The second possibility is that a &#34;gag refle XcharnameX &#34;takes effect. Just as a human e XcharnameX pels all food when the intake limit is reached, so too will XcharnameX simply, uncontrollably release all absorbed energy at once. This situation assumes XcharnameX doesn&#039;t know XcharnameX own limit, or has a low Intuition (Typical or lower).
		<br >
	The third possibility is dangerous for XcharnameX. If XcharnameX attempts to absorb more than XcharnameX limit, XcharnameX may suffer physical damage. XcharnameX can temporarily absorb greater amounts of energy in which case their Endurance Rank drops by one with each post, allowing them to absorb more energy. When XcharnameX Endureance fails (Endurance Rank equals Zero), trouble occurs. All absorbed energy is released in a single turn, doing full accumulated damage to XcharnameX.</p>",


	"energy conversion" => "<p>XcharnameX can simply change any form of energy into any other form. The transformed energy' Intensity is one rank lower than its original level. XcharnameX can transform energy by an Intensity FEAT equal to the target energy' Intensity. XcharnameX begins with the ability to transform any energy the ability to transform energy into other forms as Power stunts. There are two advantages to this Power. The first is the ability to gain an Energy Emission Power fueled by the environment. Dazzler, for example, can convert sonic energy into light. She then refined that Light Generation into a variety of effects, including lasers, light shields, and hypnotic effects.
</p><p>
	The second advantage is the ability to transform deadly force into less dangerous forms. For example, if your XcharnameX found caught in a raging firestorm, XcharnameX might Convert the heat into Cold. This would both protect XcharnameX and e XcharnameX tinguish the fire. (The paramedic shook XcharnameX head. &#34;I&#039;ll be danged if I can figure out how a man can get frostbite fighting a fire.&#34;)</p>",


	"energy solidification" => "<p>XcharnameX can transform energy into a matri XcharnameX that simulates solid matter. This matri XcharnameX may be any shape XcharnameX desires, although greater comple XcharnameX ity requires a higher Intensity FEAT to create. For example, simple solids can be formed by a Feeble FEAT. Animated forms require a Typical FEAT. Likenesses and simple machinery require an Incredible FEAT. The energy matri XcharnameX possesses Strength equal to the Power rank. It continues to exist for a duration determined by XcharnameX' Psyche. After that time, the matri XcharnameX harmlessly dissipates. Some of the uses for this Power include:
</p><p>
		<ul>
			<li>Forming servants to perform desired tasks.</li>
			<li>Creating Body Armor to protect and enhance XcharnameX' abilities.</li>
			<li>At high levels, XcharnameX can build semipermanent structures at will. Pieces that are &#34;broken off&#34;from the matri XcharnameX immediately revert to their original energy form, doing -4CS damage to the vandal.</li>
		</ul>",


	"energy vampirism" => "<p>XcharnameX can drain the energy from a target and convert that energy into extra Strength, Body, Willpower, and any other Powers he possesses by touching them. XcharnameX can force a non-living, nor sentient target to release all its energy just by touching it, while living and/or sentient targets are harder to drain, because they possess willpower which they can use to resist XcharnameX. The target' Willpower determines the rank necessary drain another; the disparity between the two opposing willpowers determines the amount of power with XcharnameX can drain the target</p>",


	"fire control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control existing flames, whether natural or Power-based. XcharnameX can alter any factor involved in combustion without direct physical contact. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the flame' Intensity up to XcharnameX Power rank and reduce fire damage by XcharnameX' rank number. This Power includes Power rank Resistance to Fire and Heat. The most important aspect of this Power is enabling XcharnameX to reshape flame into any form XcharnameX desires. This can be used in a variety of Power stunts, as XcharnameX develops numerous fiery constructs to perform miscellaneous deeds. Such fiery constructs do not act like normal flames. They emit less heat and consume less o XcharnameX ygen. Their fire doesn&#039;t spread past the outline of the constructs. In addition, they self-e XcharnameX tinguish rapidly upon cessation of this Power. Optional Powers include Fire Generation, Thermal Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.</p>",


	"gravity manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can control gravity, the force that attracts all particles to all other particles. Gravity always exists wherever there is tangible matter. (in dimensions composed entirely of energy, though, gravity is optional.)
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX doesn&#039;t really generate gravity; XcharnameX simply changes the Intensity of what' already there. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the Intensity of gravity by XcharnameX Power rank number. This effect may be centered on or projected onto a target. This permit XcharnameX to develop a variety of Power stunts:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Changing the direction of gravity.</li>
		<li>Creating artificial gravity in a normally weightless situation.</li>
		<li>Launching targets into space by reducing their weight to zero and letting the Earth' revolution fling them upward.</li>
		<li>Levitation at -1CS speed; this can be done to XcharnameX or a target.</li>
		<li>Incapacitating a foe by suddenly, drastically increasing XcharnameX weight beyond XcharnameX Strength' capacity to move.</li>
		<li>Forcing aircraft to land by increasing their weight beyond their engines&#039; lift potential.</li>
		<li>Sinking ships by making their weight e XcharnameX ceed their buoyancy.</li>
		<li>Forming large asteroids by coalescing spacial debris.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	The gravity remains altered for as long as the Power functions. After cessation, gravity returns to normal.</p>",


	"hard radiation control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control existing radiation, including XcharnameX rays, alpha, beta, gamma, and cosmic rays. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the radiation' Intensity, up to XcharnameX Power rank, and reduce the damage done by radiation up to XcharnameX Power rank number. XcharnameX can direct the flow of radiation and can alter its nature by converting any form of radiation to any other form.</p>",


	"kinetic control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control the energy of motion itself. XcharnameX can increase or decrease kinetic energy' Intensity by XcharnameX Power rank number. With a Typical Intensity FEAT, XcharnameX can change the direction of any moving target. XcharnameX can impart momentum as if XcharnameX physically pushed the target, with XcharnameX Power rank taken as Strength.
		<br >
	The primary purpose of Kinetic Control is to control Telekinesis and Kinetic Bolts. In the former case, XcharnameX can redirect the target' efforts. A FEAT equal to the target' Power rank taken as Intensity ensures this. In the latter case, XcharnameX can shape Kinetic Bolts into forms that can perform comple XcharnameX tasks. The difficulty of such tasks determines the Intensity of the required FEAT. XcharnameX can have a Bonus Power of either Telekinesis or Kinetic Bolt.</p>",


	"light control" => "<p>XcharnameX can manipulate existing light. This can be visible, infrared, or ultraviolet light. XcharnameX can alter the intensity, frequency (color, in other words), and coherence of light on a Good Intensity FEAT. XcharnameX can actually change the direction of light and -form crude holograms on a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Such holograms are little more than clouds or single-color walls. The Power allows +1CS Resistance to Light-based Powers, since XcharnameX can redirect or dispel them.</p>",


	"magnetic manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can control magnetic force. XcharnameX can increase or decrease magnetism' Intensity by his Power rank number. XcharnameX can use existing magnetism, whether natural or Power-based, to perform any desired task. XcharnameX can alter the polarity of a magnetic field (but not a neutron flow!). XcharnameX can shape the field into forms to produce any effect. These can be developed as Power Stunts. MAgnetic Manipulation can be used to control simple machinery. The simplest form is merely rendering the machine inoperable by altering the magnetism of the components. A more refined use of the Power enables XcharnameX to actually control a machine</p>",


	"plasma control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control fields of highly-charged particles. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the plasma' Intensity and reduce its damage by XcharnameX Power rank number. The Power includes Power rank Resistance to plasma' effects. The Power has two main uses. The first is shaping plasma fields into any shape desired. This can be developed into a variety of Power stunts as XcharnameX develops numerous plasm a-constructs to perform various deeds. Such constructs do possess the typical side effects of plasma fields, and dissipate upon cessation of the Power.<br >
	The second use of Plasma Control enables XcharnameX to counteract plasma related Powers. These include Plasma Generation, Energy Doppelganger, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body.</p>",


	"radiowave control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control existing radiowaves, whether AM., FM, or microwaves. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the radiowaves&#039; Intensity by XcharnameX Power rank number. A Good intensity FEAT permits XcharnameX to alter the frequency and direction of such waves and garble transmissions. XcharnameX has Power rank Resistance to radio-based attacks; such attacks are normally limited to an opponent thinking XcharnameX' a microwave oven about to cook XcharnameX' goose. The Power really comes into its own when used as a form of electronic-age Illusion Casting. That is, XcharnameX creates comple XcharnameX signals that simulate an actual broadcast. Voice-only broadcasts can be simulated by a Typical Intensity FEAT. Musical or multi-voice broadcasts require an E XcharnameX cellent Intensity FEAT, as does a still picture. A single figure with a blank background or a simple cartoon-like broadcast requires an Incredible Intensity FEAT. A single figure with a comple XcharnameX background (think of an evening news broadcast) requires a Monstrous Intensity FEAT. Any other broadcast can be simulated on a Shift XcharnameX Intensity FEAT (think Academy Awards production numbers, and you&#039;ll see why so high).
		<br >
	Obviously, this is a Power that is only really useful in high-tech campaigns. Oh, it could exist in a primitive situation, but then who would know?</p>",


	"shadowshaping" => "<p>This is not Darkforce Manipulation; that' handled elsewhere. This Power enables XcharnameX can animate existing shadows bending them to his will and cause them to reshape themselves as XcharnameX wishes with out rhyme or apparent reason. An example of this effect can be seen in Bram Stoker' Dracula in which Vlad Tepis&#039; shadow pantomimes what XcharnameX is thinking. Furthermore XcharnameX can give these shadows substance so that they can take on a phantasmal like life, capable of carrying things and performing various other simple tasks in accordance with his mental commands.<br >
		<br >
	The first number will serve as De XcharnameX terity and Strength. The second one serves as the Influence, Aura, Spirit. Body is determined by the volume of the shadows XcharnameX is animating which is equal up to a  maximum of his power rank. So if XcharnameX animated a 2000 cubic feet of shadow, then the Body would be 11. Animated shadows automatically have Two Dimensional at a level equal to the Aura you assign. They move at a speed equal to their assigned Dexterity</p>",


	"sound manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can control existing sound. XcharnameX can increase sound' Intensity by one rank by means of a Power rank FEAT or decrease it by XcharnameX Power rank number. It also provides XcharnameX with Resistance to sound-based Powers; again, XcharnameX Power rank number decreases the Intensity the attack.
		<br >
	This is possibly the single most useful Power of all those that don&#039;t do actual damage. The uses are infinite
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li> Muting the voices of an opponent group, thus preventing them from coordinating their actions.</li>
		<li> Muting alarms.</li>
		<li> Magnifying distant sounds to make them audible at XcharnameX' location </li>
		<li> Increasing faint sounds to enable XcharnameX to perform certain actions (like cracking a combination lock).</li>
		<li> Destroying boom bo XcharnameX es if XcharnameX doesn&#039;t like the music.</li>
		<li> Cranking up boom bo XcharnameX es if XcharnameX does Okay, a lot of the uses are somewhat frivolous. Still, the ability to knock out voice is a powerful weapon.</li>
	</ul>",


	"vibration control" => "<p>XcharnameX can control existing vibrations. These may be natural or Power-based. XcharnameX can increase or decrease the Intensity of the vibration by XcharnameX Power rank number. XcharnameX has Power rank Resistance to Vibration and Sonic attacks. A Power like this can make a XcharnameX e XcharnameX tremely popular in a quake-prone locale like southern California. Using the Richter scale, these are the required Intensities of the FEATs for controlling each class of earthquake.
	</p><p>\
	<em>Richter Scale</em>
	<ul>
		<li>	1 (FE - PR)</li>
		<li>	2 (TY - GD)</li>
		<li>	3 (Ex - RM)</li>
		<li>	4 (IN - AM)</li>
		<li>	5 (MN - UN)</li>
		<li>	6 (Shift X - Shift Y)</li>
		<li>	7 (Shift Z - CL1000)</li>
		<li>	8 (CL3000 - CL5000)</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Okay, if California is determined to fall into the sea, you won&#039;t be much help. Of course, if your XcharnameX possesses Vibration as well, XcharnameX might get blamed for the quake. On a smaller scale, the Power can be used in a variety of everyday situations:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li> XcharnameX can distort or even mute a target' voice. This effectively negates vocal Powers. This is done by directly affecting the target' laryn XcharnameX. </li>
		<li> If your campaign includes other Dimensions that can be reached by adjusting your vibratory rate to that of the chosen dimension, then this Power will do the trick on an Amazing Intensity FEAT. </li>
		<li> XcharnameX can cripple gyroscopes, thus disabling any vehicles dependent on them (subs, aircraft). This is a Typical Intensity FEAT, which incidentally also works against robots. </li>
		<li> XcharnameX can adjust the vibratory rate of XcharnameX own atoms, permitting XcharnameX to Phase through solid objects or let solids (like bullets) pass harmlessly through XcharnameX.</li>
	</ul>"

$arrPowEnergyEmission = [

	"cold generation" => "<p>
		This Power is the pure form of Ice Generation and one it is often confused with. The hero can emit a field that decreases thermal energy and infrared radiation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Power decreases the temperature of the target; the amount is determined both by a FEAT and the Power rank number. A Typical FEAT drops the temperature by 10x the rank number; a Remarkable FEAT drops it by 20x the rank number; and an Unearthly FEAT drops it by 40x the rank number. For example, a hero with Remarkable Cold Generation can lower a target&quotes temperature by 300 (10x30) to 1200 (40x3O) degrees. The only limitation is that the temperature cannot drop lower than absolute zero (-273 degrees Celsius or -459.4 degrees Fahrenheit).
	</p>
	<p>
		The power has the side-effect of cooling the air between XcharnameX  and the target. Gases within that area may condense. Such by-products evaporate quickly after the Power ceases to operate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cold Generation can be used to negate other sources of cold, whether Power-based, artificial, or environmental; its Power rank decreases the intensity of the affected cold. However, it cannot be used to raise the temperature of a frigid environment. The hero with this Power has Power rank level resistance to Cold in any form.
	</p>
	<p>
		Optional Powers include Coldshaping, Condensation, Solidification, and Molding. Nemeses include Heat Emission, Fire Generation, and Thermal Control.
	</p>",


	"electrical generation" => "<p>
		The hero can create electrical streams that can do Power rank damage. The hero can project the electricity through any conductive medium, such as air, water, or metal, at Power rank range. If the player chooses, XcharnameX  can gain +2CS to his damage by choosing to limit his range to contact only. In this case, the range can be extended by conducting the Power through solid conductors like metal. Electricity comes in various forms:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Static electricity causes magnetic attraction between objects and can disrupt electronic communications.</li>
		</li>
		<li>Lightning is sheer, raw, destructive power and by far the most popular form of this Power.</li>
		<li>Alternating current is what our technology is driven by. This Power can either energize or overload normal electrical devices.</li>
		<li>Direct current is what a battery produces. It can energize or overload devices that use DC power. It can also short out devices that use AC power.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The hero can use any form at will or can raise his rank +1CS by specializing in a particular form. This Power automatically includes Power rank Resistance to Electricity; no FEAT is required to resist your own Power. This Power is linked to Electrical Control and Energy Sheath. When creating XcharnameX , the player can exchange any randomly determined Powers for these if he so desires. Extreme heat reduces this Power&quotes rank by the Intensity rank of the heat. Conversely, extreme cold increases the rank by the cold&quotes Intensity rank. At Shift X level, XcharnameX  gains the ability to create a stream of conductive gas, thus allowing the Power to function even in a vacuum.
		</p>",


		"energy doppelganger" => "<p>The hero can generate an Energy Body from his own body. This Doppelganger can have 		Powers of its own, including those characteristic to the type of energy of which the Doppelganger is composed.The Doppelganger automatically has the Power of True Flight, While the player can decide which Powers are possessed by whom, a rule of thumb is that the majority of physical Powers are assigned to the Doppelganger. The player must also decide whether the Doppelganger is simply an extension of XcharnameX &quotes will or if it has an independent, but obedient, mind. If the player chooses the latter he raises the Power rank +1CS; he can raise it another +1CS by having the lapse into unconsciousness when he uses the Power, since his mind is directly tied into maintaining the Doppelganger&quotes existence. Any damage to the Doppelganger is subtracted from XcharnameX&quotes Psyche.</p>
		<p>Rank determines the duration of the Doppelganger and the minimum ran any Powers it possesses. Normally XcharnameX  can generate only one Doppelganger at a time. At extremely high ranks, XcharnameX  can generate additional Doppelgangers. The number is equal to 1% of the Power rank number (round up). For example, at Class 1000 rank XcharnameX  can create 10 simultaneous beings.</p>
		<p>Such beings have a decreased Resistance (-2CS) to plasma-based attacks since these disrupt the energy field that forms the Doppelganger. They possess an increased Resistance (+4CS) to attacks based on Light, Heat, Flame, Vibrations, and Sonics, since they have no solid mass to affect.</p>
		<p>The Nemesis Power is Plasma Control.</p>",


	"fire generation" => "<p>The hero can project fire with Power rank damage and range. These flames have no apparent fuel source and spring from XcharnameX  as if he were a living fuel tank. Although the flames&quote fuel comes out of the proverbial nowhere, free oxygen must be present for the Power to function. If not, XcharnameX  can cause a single flame that lasts&quote only one turn, then fizzles out. At Shift X rank, XcharnameX  gains the ability to generate oxygen as well, permitting this Power to function under any conditions. When creating XcharnameX , the player can choose the Powers of Flame Control, Energy Sheath, and Energy Body to fill any slots still open. For example, under the Ultimate system, the Human Torch possesses three powers: Fire Generation, Fire Control, and Energy Sheath.</p>
		<p>This has to be the most dangerous Power around. Heroes have to watch out for accidental firestorms. They also tend to consume all the oxygen in their location, making everyone pass out. Then there is the question of smoke and gases created by XcharnameX &quotes Flame Power. It makes me wonder what kind of ventilation system the Baxter Building has...</p>
		<p>Fire Generation is the opposing Power to Cold Emission, Coldshaping, and Powers that use water. This Power gains +1CS when fighting these Powers. It also loses -1CS when being attacked by those Powers.</p>",


	"hard radiation" => "<p>This covers the dangerous section of the energy spectrum: ultraviolet light, x-rays, and alpha and beta particles, gamma rays, and the ever-popular &ldquo;cosmic rays.&rdquo; The hero can project any of these types at Power rank range and damage. When creating XcharnameX , the player can raise his rank +1CS by specializing in a particular type of hard radiation. For game purposes, we&quotell assume that XcharnameX  has total control over his own inherent radioactivity and possesses automatic safe-guards that prevent him from fatally contaminating the area each time he uses his Power. This Power is linked to Radiation Control; the player can exchange one of his other Powers for Radiation Control when creating XcharnameX , if he so desires.</p>",


	"heat" => "<p>The hero can generate pure heat that is not necessarily accompanied by light or flame by accelerating 	molecular motion. This permits XcharnameX  to do rank level effects over target materials. Some Power Stunts 	 using pure heat include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Causing the breakdown of molecular or even atomic bonds (Amazing and Unearthly FEATs, respectively).</li> 	<li>Negating a target&quotes magnetism</li>
			<li>Negating a target&quotes electrical conductivity.</li>
			<li>Strengthening materials by heat-treating.</li>
			<li>Changing local weather by heating the air; this can cause small cyclones and electrical storms.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Because this Power uses pure heat, it can function in conditions that negate Flame Emission, like the absence of free Oxygen or XcharnameX &quotes being underwater. Beings who possess Thermal Vision or Abnormal Sensitivity can detect an infrared glow around, XcharnameX  and his target whenever he uses his Power. Heat Emission is the Nemesis of Cold Emission, Coldshaping, and Powers that use water. This Power gains +1CS when attacking those Powers and loses -1CS when being attacked by them.
		</p>",


	"kinetic bolt" => "<p>This is a crude form of M30/Telekinesis. The hero can strike a target with a surge of force at Power rank range and damage. The Kinetic Bolt can be shaped as desired by XcharnameX . It can be a wide cylinder, or an incredibly fine needle. Its effect is the same as if the target had been struck by a solid object of equal material strength. This Power can affect only tangible materials. It includes Resistance to Kinetic Bolts, Kinetic Control, or Telekinesis. Optional Powers are Kinetic Control and Telekinesis, which are also the Nemeses.
		</p>",


	"light emission" => "<p>
		The hero can emit powerful bursts of light do Power rank damage at rank range. The light may be of any nature:</p>
		<li>Normal light in any color or intensity; XcharnameX  can light the area, dispel Shadow Powers, and temporarily blind targets.</li>
		<li>Coherent Light (lasers) do rank level heat damage as they burn into targets. Lasers can also be used to carry information or to create holograms.</li>
		<li>Optic blasts do rank level damage but rather than burn a target, they act as Kinetic Bolts.
		The player can raise XcharnameX &quotes rank upon creation by +2CS if he chooses specialization in a specific form of this Power.
		</li>",


	"magnetism" => "<p>
		The hero can generate intense magnetic force. The magnetic field may be centered on XcharnameX &quotes body or be projected at rank range. The field can affect anything susceptible to magnetism, attracting it with Power rank Strength. If the target itself is magnetic, he hero can attract it at +1CS or repel it at Power rank. The hero can induce magnetism into any materials that can sustain a magnetic field; these include ferrous materials, iron-bearing clays and plastics, and ferrous ores. The hero can do rank level damage to electronic devices by scrambling internal signals; this is especially effective against magnetic recordings and micro-chip dependent devices. This Power can affect other Powers. It can redirect Electrical Generation by a Typical Intensity FEAT if the other Power&quotes rank is lower, a Remarkable Intensity FEAT if equal, and an Unearthly Intensity FEAT if the other Power is higher. It can disrupt Electric or Magnetic Control and Energy Sheath or Energy Body, if either are magnetic in nature.</p>
	<p>
		The Power has its drawbacks. It attracts some types of attacks if XcharnameX  is careless. Such attacks as Electrical Generation or anything using ferrous materials (knives, missiles) gain +2CS. This Power is its own primary Nemesis.
		</p>",


	"plasma generation" => "<p>
		Plasma refers to here to a field of highly-charged particles. Common examples include the aurora borealis, the glow in a fluorescent tube, the Van Allen Belt, and the heart of a nuclear blast. Plasmas may be of any nature: fiery, magnetic, electrical, radioactive, or be of a previously unknown form of energy. This last group includes many super-powers, living energy fields, and beings who can transform themselves into pure energy.</p>
		<p>The hero can project Plasma fields at Power rank range. Due to the unique nature of this Power, it does damage on two levels. The primary level is brute force; the field does Power rank damage There are also side-effects based on the nature of each Plasma bolt. Plasma fields have two of the following side effects:<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Light at -2CS level of illumination </li>
			<li>Heat at -2CS damage </li>
			<li>Flame at -2CS damage</li>
			<li>Hard Radiation at -2CS damage</li>
			<li>Magnetism at -2CS damage but full Power rank range</li>
			<li>Electricity at -2CS damage.<li>
		</ul>
		<p>The hero initially possesses a single type of Plasma with two set side-effects that occur each time he uses his Power. Later he can develop other Plasmas with different side-effects as Power Stunts.</p>
		<p>Plasma is a Nemesis to the Powers of Energy Sheath and Energy Body. The hero gains +1CS when attacking either Power. Plasma&quotes own Nemeses are Plasma Control and Power Control.</p>",


	"radiowave generation" => "<p>
		The hero can generate radiowaves, including AM and FM signals and microwaves. This Power primarily affects broadcasting and electronics; the Power can do rank damage over rank range to these. The Power can also be used to directly affect any target by internally heating it through microwave bombardment. Used in this manner, the Power has -2CS on its damage and range.</p>
		<p>Optional Powers include Radiowave Control, Energy Sheath, and Carrier Wave. Nemeses include Radiowave Control, Energy Absorption, and Force Field vs. Energy.
		</p>",


	"shadowcasting" => "<p>
		The hero can emit a field that decreases light and radiation. The obscured energy&quotes Intensity is lowered by the Power&quotes rank taken as Intensity. The energy forms that can be affected by this Power are Light, Heat, Hard Radiation, Radiowaves, Energy Doppelgangers, and Energy Bodies.</p>
		<p>The hero possesses the ability to affect only Light when his Power is at Good rank. At each rank above Good, he gains the ability to affect another energy form in the following order: EX-Heat, RM-Hard Radiation, IN-Radiowaves, AM-Energy Doppelgangers, MN-Energy Bodies.</p>
		<p>This Power includes the ability to see clearly through his own natural or Power- created shadows of Intensity less that XcharnameX &quotes Power rank.</p>
		<p>The Power can disrupt Darkforce Manipulation on a Typical Intensity FEAT if its rank is higher than that of the Darkforce manipulator, Remarkable Intensity FEAT if they are equal, and Unearthly Intensity FEAT if the Power&quotes rank is lower.</p>
		<p>Optional Powers include Shadow- shaping and Darkforce Manipulation.</p>
		<p>The Nemesis is Light Emission.</p>",


	"sonic generation" => "<p>
		The hero can generate intense sound and make attacks of Power rank range and damage. This Power can generate frequencies normally inaudible. The hero can disrupt other sound-based Powers by creating dissonance as his harmonics clash with the second Power&quotes harmonics. The hero&quotes own rank is subtracted from the target harmonic&quotes Intensity. Optional Powers include Sonic Control, Vibration, and Vibration Control. Nemeses are this Power itself and the three just listed. The Power needs a medium to carry the sound, whether gaseous, liquid, or solid. It cannot function in a vacuum unless XcharnameX  is touching a solid through which he can transmit his Power. This Power can be used in tandem with the Power of Speech-Throwing to permit Sonic Generation to affect even unconnected targets in a vacuum.
		</p>",


	"vibration" => "<p>
		The hero can generate non-audible vibrations. These can alter existing harmonics, effectively negating any sonic- or vocal-based Power. The hero can cause tremors at Power rank range and damage. The Power can even be used to incapacitate living targets; effects can vary from motion sickness (nausea and vomiting) to death by internal hemmorhaging.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Power includes Resistance to Vibratory attacks. Optional Powers include Vibration Control and Sonic Generation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some possible Power Stunts include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Forming a vibratory shield that can provide up to +2CS protection. The vibrations make XcharnameX  harder to hit as weapons are thrust aside by the field. At higher ranks it can even cause the weapon&quotes own structure to collapse.</li>
			<li>Negating vocal powers by sending XcharnameX &quotes own vibrations into the target&quotes larynx. For example, your hero could reduce Lorelei&quotes song to a gurgle.</li>
			<li>Throwing machinery out of kilter by vibrating delicate components.</li>

Reason and Psyche plummet to Feeble rank while the ranks for Strength and Fighting increase by the same number of ranks. (That is, the total number of points lost are split evenly between the Fighting and Strength ranks.) XcharnameX also develops Iron Will for the duration of the Berserker rage; the rank for this is the same as the Berserker Power' rank. The Berserker lasts for the length of combat and 10 turns. When the rage ends, all the altered Abilities return to their original ranks. Since the Iron Will also disappears, XcharnameX finally feels the effects of any damage he suffered while in the Berserker rage.
</p><p>
	See &#039;Stats&#039; for definitions regarding Ranks &amp; Ranges.</p>",


	"hyper-neural network" => "<p>XcharnameX neural network works at quantum speeds, allowing XcharnameX to calculate over a million possible combat scenarios in a second, informing XcharnameX of the perfect counter to any attack. In effect, many people appear almost to be in slow motion to XcharnameX during combat or other life -</strong>threatening situations. This ability effectively allows him to double his initiative during combat.</p>",


	"martial arts supremacy" => "<p>While Fighting is considered a skill and not a Power, this power raises XcharnameX' already -</strong>mastered Martial Arts (See Skills) to dramatically higher levels by combining the ranks of the skill with that of the Martial Arts Supremacy, thus allowing XcharnameX to perform actions that would otherwise be impossible, like splitting a battleship in two with a single karate chop.</p>",


	"natural weapondry" => "<p>XcharnameX' body contains special anatomical features that can function as weapons. These may be of any nature and can be external, internal, or retractable. If these are damaged XcharnameX suffers as if they were normal body parts. When creating XcharnameX. the player decides the nature of the weaponry. The weaponry chosen possesses this Power and rank taken as material strength for purposes of determining potential damage. Each time the player rolls this Power, he can add another weapon to XcharnameX. As stated in the Player' Book, some forms of Natural Weaponry provide Bonus Powers (see &#34;Claws&#34;and &#34;extra Body Parts&#34;). These are placed in the ne XcharnameX t available slot in the Power Generation. The player and the Judge need to work together to create a functional XcharnameX. A drawback to this Power is that if XcharnameX is somehow deprived of his Natural Weaponry, he suffers a loss to his Fighting Ability equal to his weapon' rank. example: Due to a mishap with a matter transmitter, Wolverine temporarily loses his claws. XcharnameX' so shaken that his normal Incredible Fighting Ability drops to Feeble. If the Natural Weaponry is made of materials not normally found in the body, it makes XcharnameX vulnerable to attacks that affect those materials. For instance, Wolvie has a -</strong>1CS resistance to Magneto' powers, since they can affect his metal skeleton.</p>",


	"weapons creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create any desired weapon out of thin air. The weapon can be of any design, size, and material. The size of the weapon is limited by its weight. XcharnameX can only create in a single turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to his Power rank number. XcharnameX avier weapons have to be assembled in pieces over a span of several turns. While the material strength of the created weapon is the same as that of a normally -</strong>manufactured weapon of the same type, its duration is much shorter. The lifespan of the weapon is determined at the time of creation. A Typical Intensity FEAT gives the weapon a lifespan of 100 turns times XcharnameX' Reason rank number. On an Amazing Intensity FEAT, the weapon lasts for XcharnameX' Reason rank number times 10,000 turns. Should he make an Unearthly Intensity FEAT, the weapon will be permanent. Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs XcharnameX 1 XcharnameX alth point. All points lost in this manner are regained after 24 hours. Thus, XcharnameX can only create a weapon weighing the number of ounces equal to his XcharnameX alth score in a single day.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must have-detailed knowledge of any weapon he wants to create. XcharnameX can only store a limited number of weapons&#039; designs in his memory. The total number of memory slots available to this Power equals XcharnameX' Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the weapons he can create. This list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains XcharnameX a new design. If no open memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally, the Power is used to make facsimiles of existing weapons. XcharnameX must make a detailed study of the weapon for at least 10 minutes before attempting a FEAT. Failure to make the FEAT means XcharnameX must spend another 10 minutes studying the weapon before attempting another FEAT. Some weapons might be beyond XcharnameX' comprehension, if the player has really bad luck when rolling the dice.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create new weapons based solely on his imagination and basic knowledge of weapons design. This requires intense concentration and a red Power rank FEAT.
</p><p>
	The newly created weapon has the same characteristics as a normally created one of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary weapons, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable and playable set of characteristics for the weapon in question. The Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the throwing daggers and broadswords that clutter XcharnameX' mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any weapon' shape. This permits XcharnameX to change the composition of any already-memorized designs. For example, if he has already memorized the design of an arrow and the nature of silver he can create both wood and steel arrows and silver arrows. Weapons created materialize in XcharnameX' hands.
</p><p>
	There is an exceptionto the rules thus far. When creating XcharnameX. the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a special weapon. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per XcharnameX alth point to one pound per XcharnameX alth point. Such special weapons are never permanent; Unearthly Intensity FEATs are treated the same as Amazing Intensity ones. One example of this option is Magik' Soulsword.</p>",


	"weapons tinkering" => "<p>XcharnameX can devise and assemble any weapon that can be made with the available materials. By means of a red FEAT, XcharnameX can even improvise a means of creating unavailable materials (adamantium, for example). Provided he has the resources, XcharnameX can assemble a functional copy of any weapon. As to what weapons he can make, use the Resource costs are listed in the Hardware section of our site.
</p><p>
	When creating XcharnameX. the player can choose to make the character a jack-of-all- trades or specialist in a particular field. If XcharnameX chooses to specialize, XcharnameX can raise the rank by two. Categories of weapons include:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Edged and Blunt weapons</li>
		<li>Projectile weapons</li>
		<li>Energy weapons</li>

		<li>Alien weapons</li>
		<li>Battlesuits</li>
		<li>War robots</li>

	Needless to say, the player will have to develop stats for anything XcharnameX comes up with. If XcharnameX successfully copies existing technology, like the Iron Man battlesuit or a SHIELD Plasma Beam Handgun, XcharnameX can simply use the established stats for that device. A clever character can also use this Power to make money off of other characters by building weapons on commission. After all, somebody' got to be building all those super-weapons that fill the pages of comic books..."

$aarPowIllusions = [
	"animate image" => "<p>This is a specialized form of Illusion-casting that enables XcharnameX to apparently bring any flat image XcharnameX sees to life. Whatever the original nature of the image-drawing, painting, photograph, print-the image appears to gain a sense of three dimensionality and independent movement. A blank white area now fills the area formerly occupied by the newly solidified Image.
</p><p>
	In actuality, XcharnameX has created two Illusions. The obvious one is that of the animated image that has peeled itself away from its flat background and filled out into three dimensions. The second, more subtle Illusion is the &#34;blank white space formerly occupied by the now apparently animated image.&#34;XcharnameX automatically casts this Illusion to mask out the still-existing original picture; for as long as XcharnameX concentrates on the illusion or until the primary Illusion ceases to exist, whichever comes first.
</p><p>
	The initial range at which XcharnameX can Animate an Image is recognizable line-of-sight (100 yards). This is also the  maximum range at which XcharnameX can normally maintain the &#34;realism&#34;of the Illusion. Simply put, XcharnameX has to be able to clearly see both the Image and its surroundings. When either is beyond XcharnameX vision, the believability of the Image drops drastically. When the Image gets beyond XcharnameX' field of clear vision, XcharnameX can no longer make it realistically conform to the surroundings.
</p><p>
	Unbeknownst to Kinescope, the alley is full of trash cans, which the lion blithely passes through. This muggers see this and realize they&#039;ve been had. Kinescope gets a surprise when XcharnameX comes around the corner. This Image can exist for as long as XcharnameX concentrates on maintaining it (the Judge is free to determine how easily this can be done given the circumstances XcharnameX finds themselves in).
</p><p>
	Although the Image can only be realistically controlled within one area of XcharnameX' location, the Image can be projected up to the full range for this Power. Once beyond the one area limit, the Image is easily perceived by others as a holographic projection. XcharnameX can overcome this limit by e XcharnameX tending the range of XcharnameX own senses, either through artificial means (telescopes, remote TV camera, etcetera) or by using sense e XcharnameX tending Powers. In such cases, XcharnameX can e XcharnameX tend realistic control of the Image up to the range limits for this Power and whatever means XcharnameX employs to e XcharnameX tend XcharnameX' vision.</p>",


	"illusion casting" => "<p>XcharnameX can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity. Thisse Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the target' mind and cannot affect mechanical senses.
</p><p>
	This Illusion can take any size or appearance XcharnameX desires and is limited only by XcharnameX' imagination. This Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from XcharnameX' mind, or an abstract display of light. XcharnameX is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend. on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. XcharnameX can cast Illusions anywhere XcharnameX can see within XcharnameX power rank range, though XcharnameX must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if XcharnameX wants to make it at all realistic. This normal limit for unaided vision is one area (132 feet). Beyond that range XcharnameX can no longer clearly see XcharnameX Illusion' surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast two areas away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If XcharnameX is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of XcharnameX' Illusions, this limit can be ignored. XcharnameX does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, freefloating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If XcharnameX possesses a means of e XcharnameX tending the range of XcharnameX' senses, XcharnameX can maintain the realism m of XcharnameX' Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means XcharnameX uses to e XcharnameX tend XcharnameX' vision. Ways of increasing the senses&#039; range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense-e XcharnameX tending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance.
</p><p>
	example: Deetee has an Incredible rank and can Illusion-Cast up to two miles away. XcharnameX also has a good pair of binoculars that enable XcharnameX' to see up to one mile away. For idle amusement, XcharnameX likes to go to the top of tall buildings and Cast Illusions at the pedestrians below. S XcharnameX also like to find the monitors for remote surveillance cameras and use them to direct XcharnameX' Illusions into locked rooms. Illusions last as long as XcharnameX concentrates on maintaining their existence. This Judge is free to determine how long XcharnameX can maintain XcharnameX concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking XcharnameX' concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). This Illusion' effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion-caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion' true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. this can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. (&#34;Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast.). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light-based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping XcharnameX cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy. Illusion Casting can be combined with other Powers to give 1 XcharnameX Illusion enhanced realism; this can also create Illusions that do real physical damage. If the Illusion-caster has any of the Energy Emission Powers, these can be redirected to apparently originate from the Illusion rather than from XcharnameX. For example, combining this Power with Plasma Generation would simulate the Phoenix-force and fry any electronics in the area.
</p><p>
	More commonly, the power is used to disguise the true nature of anything XcharnameX or XcharnameX' companions might be doing. example: Deetee and XcharnameX' buddy Jayboy have to break into a certain building that they know is under surveillance. Deetee doesn&#039;t care about subtlety, only About distraction, and casts an Illusion of a,.Large elephant that comes lumbering around a corner and lies down in front of the door. Inside the elephantine Illusion, Jayboy is free to use XcharnameX Kinetic Bolt Power to smash open the door. XcharnameX also uses XcharnameX K-bolts to simulate the effect the elephant' legs have when they kick against a target. This main drawback to Illusion-Casting is that XcharnameX must keep XcharnameX Power' true nature a secret from XcharnameX adversaries. It must be presented as if it were another Power entirely.
</p><p>
	For example, although XcharnameX is an Illusion-caster, Deetee often presents XcharnameX' self as a Demon-Summoner. Even if the Power' nature is public knowledge, the Power is still effective. This Powers of Light Emission and Light Control are innate factors of Illusion Casting. As such, XcharnameX has the ability to generate any intensity and frequency of light. XcharnameX can warp light, alter its frequency, and change its degree of co XcharnameX'ency. XcharnameX can do -2CS rank level damage using light-based attacks. As noted earlier, the Power includes - 2CS Resistance to Light-based attacks; XcharnameX simply casts an Illusion of something opaque between XcharnameX' self and the offending light. XcharnameX can simulate other visual Powers or Talents with some effectiveness as well; the -2CS limit is used as a guide for determining how well XcharnameX can do these things. example: Once inside the building, Deetee and Jay-boy discover a guard. Deetee casts an Illusion of Ringmaster and tries to hypnotize the guard. XcharnameX' Incredible rank is reduced to merely E XcharnameX cellent when s XcharnameX tries simulate Hypnotic Control. Fortunately that is enough; the guard falls under the spurious Ringmaster' control. Powers that are a part of or can be simulated by Illusion-Casting may include:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Force Field vs. Energy</li>
		<li>Resistance to Energy</li>
		<li>Energy Detection (Light)</li>
		<li>Light Control</li>
		<li>Shadowshaping</li>
		<li>Hard Radiation Emission (UV Light)</li>
		<li>Heat (infrared Light)</li>
		<li>Light Emission</li>
		<li>Shadowcasting</li>
		<li>Animate Image</li>
		<li>Illusory Invisibility</li>
		<li>Illusory Duplication</li>
		<li>Hypnotic Control</li>
		<li>Coloration</li>
		<li>Hallucinations</li>
		<li>Blending</li>
		<li>Energy Sheath (Light)</li>
		<li>Self-Vegetation</li>
		<li>Shapeshifting</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	A drawback in characters who have this Power is that they tend to become philosophical about the relationship between Reality and Illusion. Companions find themselves drawn into interminable arguments about what is real and what is not. Illusion-Casters may even begin to feel that they themselves are an Illusion being cast by some unknown being.</p>",


	"illusionary invisibility" => "<p>this is not true Invisibility but is actually a clever simulation. This effects are nearly the same, anyway; XcharnameX becomes effectively invisible to any living or artificial being. XcharnameX actually remains visible but XcharnameX can now surround XcharnameX with a holographic Illusion of empty space. this field can be limited to XcharnameX' body or increased to cover a large area. This  maximum radius of this effect is the number of feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Poor rank could cover an area e XcharnameX tending four feet from XcharnameX. a Monstrous rank could cover an area e XcharnameX tending 75 feet, and a Class 1000 rank could cover a square mile. Within the, Illusory Invisibility, things remain visible. From the point of view of anyone within the Power' protection, it appears that the area has been surrounded by an irregularly-shaped transparent balloon that causes weird tricks of light. Outside the &#34;balloon&#34;a viewer sees only the Illusion of empty space, even if the viewer has just stepped out of the invisibility field. Standing at the edge of the field can result in a XcharnameX adac XcharnameX as the viewer' eyes see both the reality and the Illusion. this Power can be cast at a target point some distance away. This area limit is the same. This  maximum range at which the Illusory Invisibility can appear is determined by the Power rank. For example, a Monstrous rank permits XcharnameX to hide an area 150 feet wide (75 foot radius, remember?) located up to si XcharnameX miles away.
</p><p>
	Of course, XcharnameX has to be able to see XcharnameX intended target; otherwise XcharnameX would be unable to simulate the appearance of emptiness appropriate to the target area. When casting this Power at ground level, a practical limit to range is one area (132 feet) from XcharnameX. Casi!ng an Illusory Invisibility in the air or in space is easier and can be done at rank level range. Note that as this is an Illusion, it can be detected by careful visual e XcharnameX amination or the simplest of physical tests. This &#34;empty space&#34;is only what XcharnameX imagines such an empty space to look like. As XcharnameX tries to hide more area, the problems of realism multiply. If the Illusory Invisibility and the viewer move in relationship to each other, the viewer might be able to detect a slight distortion of light at the edge of the field. (This player can imagine it by thinking of a clear drinking glass.) example: Consider an airship surrounded by a mechanically created version of Illusory Invisibility. Inside the airship, vision is unaffected. This crew can clearly see the world below. This field e XcharnameX tends one foot around the airship. From the ground and sides the ship is invisible. This flaw is when the field is viewed from above; a viewer sees the ground below but may realize that the surface detail is not continuous. Rivers And roads have sudden, une XcharnameX plained gaps.
</p><p>
	Since the Invisibility is holographic in nature, it can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography, television, and the mechanical senses.of artificial oeings. It can also be seen at any distance and will deceive telescopes, remote cameras, and Telescopic Vision used outside the field' effect. Sensory Link can be deceived if that Power is used to link up with a viewer outside the field; if it is used to link with someone inside the field, the deception fails. Clairvoyance cannot detect Illusions at all and thus would also penetrate the deception. This Power cannot deceive any of the other senses or such Powers as Sonar, Radar, or Psionics.
</p><p>
	For example, Daredevil would be unaware of such a field even being employed; this can lead to Problems for Matt Murdock. (&#34;What I don&#039;t understand, DD, is how did you know the Dreadnought wasn&#039;t real?&#34;)
</p><p>
	This Power provides limited protection against light-based attacks originating outside the field. this is equivalent to a Force Field vs. Light with a -2CS rank. For example, a Good form of this Power provides Poor protection against lasers and hypnotic lights.
</p><p>
	This main protection it offers is that if the viewer doesn&#039;t know there is something to shoot at, then XcharnameX won&#039;t shoot. This Invisibility lasts as long as XcharnameX can maintain XcharnameX concentration. In the case of mechanically-derived Invisibility, it lasts for as long as the equipment functions. Judges are free to decide the difficulty of either case in any given circumstance.
</p><p>
	For example, the Judge decides that the above-mentioned airship' Invisibility Generator can function for up to ten hours of continuous operation but shuts down if it receives a single jolt of electricity with Amazing Intensity. XcharnameX can terminate XcharnameX Invisibility at any time, either purposely or accidentally. Simple physical contact can alert a viewer to XcharnameX' presence, w XcharnameX ther XcharnameX accidentally envelops XcharnameX in the field or XcharnameX makes a distance attack at the target. A spray of a coating material will temporarily reveal the e XcharnameX tent of the field; in the middle of an obscuring cloud, the field shows as a silhouette of clear air. Once XcharnameX' realizes that XcharnameX field is visible, XcharnameX can correct the Illusion to reflect the new addition to XcharnameX surroundings; this takes a green Intuition FEAT. Note: the Judge should roll this for XcharnameX without telling the player XcharnameX has become visible; failure means XcharnameX has either not yet realized XcharnameX predicament or has not yet gotten the Illusion properly altered. Optional Powers include Light Control and Light Emission. Nemesis Powers include Light Control, Radar, and Sonar.</p>",


	"illusionary duplication" => "<p>this is a specialized form of Illusion-Casting that permits XcharnameX to generate completely realistic simulations of a single object, namely XcharnameX. Unlike the other Illusory Powers, this permits XcharnameX to see through these nonexistent senses and to communicate through apparently normal speech.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create a finite number of e XcharnameX act holographic duplicates of XcharnameX. These are Illusions based on XcharnameX' selfimage, which XcharnameX had best make sure matc XcharnameX s XcharnameX actual appearance at that moment. This accuracy of the Duplicate is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Duplicate is generated. A green Reason FEAT means the Illusory Duplicates are somehow different from XcharnameX ; they have the wrong outfit on, are too muscular or handsome, and so on. A yellow or red Reason FEAT produces a perfect copy. This  maximum number of simultaneous duplicates XcharnameX can create is equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. Although Duplicates are frequently used to surround XcharnameX and act as decoys, the duplicates can also function several areas or miles away from XcharnameX. This  maximum range at which XcharnameX can either send or create a Duplicate is determined by XcharnameX Power rank; specific levels are shown on column B. example: Myriad has an Incredible rank. this enables XcharnameX to create up to 40 simultaneously existing Duplicates that can form or travel as far as two miles away from XcharnameX location. This Duplicates are intangible holographs and are incapable of doing any actual physical activity. Thisy are primarily used as decoys, messengers, spies, and simulated ghosts. This duplicates can form in any location within XcharnameX' range, regardless of wether XcharnameX can see that location or not. As an aspect of this Power, XcharnameX automatically possesses a combination of Clairvoyance, Clairaudience, and Speech throwing that permits XcharnameX to see, XcharnameX ar, and speak through remote Duplicates.
</p><p>
	For example, Myriad is at the scene of a cave-in. This rescue crew need to know where any survivors are located. Myriad creates several Duplicates and sends them off into the debris. Since these are energy, the Duplicates can pass effortlessly through the rock. Myriad sees what the Duplicates &#34;see.&#34;Thisre is no light in the collapsed area but Myriad' Duplicates each carry an illusion of a flashlight that functions as well, if not better, than a real one. Finally two of the Duplicates find survivors., This first group of survivors are only lost; the Duplicate leads them through the darkness to safety. This second group is trapped behind fallen rock. Thisy are startled when the Duplicate passes through the rock into their area but Myriad speaks through XcharnameX Duplicate and appraises them of the situation. This Duplicate remains with them until the rescuers finally reach them.
</p><p>
	When creating XcharnameX. the player has the option of assigning some or all of XcharnameX' other Powers to the Duplicates. XcharnameX can only create a single such powerful duplicate at any one time. Since this duplicate now has a greater effect on reality, it gains some reality as well. Such duplicates can be affected and even destroyed by such attacks as Light Emission, Light Generation, Plasma Generation, Plasma Control, Shadowcasting, and any of the Magics and Power Controls. This duplicate has a &#34;XcharnameX alth&#34;equal to this Power' rank number. Any damage to the duplicate is subtracted from this number. At zero the duplicate suddenly vanis XcharnameX s. In addition, any damage done to the duplicate is also suffered by XcharnameX. who temporarily loses a number of points equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. Such points are regained just like XcharnameX alth points.
</p><p>
	All Duplicates can be affected by the Powers of Light Control and Shadowcasting. Light Control can overpower, distort, and even destroy any Duplicate. It can be use to seize control of a Duplicate away from XcharnameX ; the effect is analogous to someone using Mind Control/ Puppetry on XcharnameX' own body. Shadowcasting can surround the Duplicate in darkness and prevent XcharnameX' Clairvoyance from operating. If the Shadowcasting has a greater rank, that Power can be used to destroy a Duplicate. Note: when a Duplicate is passing through solids, its &#34;eyes&#34;register total darkness. If XcharnameX is unaware that Shadowcasting is being used against XcharnameX Duplicates, then XcharnameX will assume the continued darkness is the result of the Duplicate remaining within a solid mass and consequently will make no attempt to resist this clandestine attack. As stated earlier, all Duplicates are an illusionary manifestation of XcharnameX' self-image. This need not be a single, static design but can change with XcharnameX' w XcharnameX. Generally, all Duplicates at a given moment will have the same shape. However, by means of a red Reason FEAT, XcharnameX can create simultaneous Duplicates who have different appearances. All such differences are still based on XcharnameX' own form. A red FEAT is needed for each different type of Duplicate. example: Myriad maintains a secret identity as a physicist at a nuclear plant in Georgia. One day the plant is attacked by supervillains. Myriad must take action but XcharnameX civilian identity must remain at XcharnameX emergency post. Myriad forms a number of Duplicates. Most resemble XcharnameX' super-XcharnameXic self but Myriad alters one to appear as XcharnameX civilian self. This extra form requires additional concentration on Myriad' part and a red FEAT. This player blows it on the first roll (a 23), second roll (03), third roll (24), but finally makes it on the fourth roll (00). Myriad castigates XcharnameX on the additional 24 seconds it took XcharnameX to generate the lab coat and glasses. While Duplicates are normally created as independent beings, the Power can also be cast around XcharnameX' own body to immediately alter XcharnameX' own appearance. this is usually used to make quick disguises and costume changes. If XcharnameX so chooses, XcharnameX entire super XcharnameX' appearance and costume can be nothing more than such a Illusion wrapped around XcharnameX' normal civilian self. this would definitely prevent anyone from finding your costume stas XcharnameX d in the back of the closet. In the previous example, Myriad had not thought to bring XcharnameX costume to work and had to form one of XcharnameX Duplicates around XcharnameX. This drawback is that if XcharnameX loses concentration, consciousness, or Power, XcharnameX also loses XcharnameX' costume. (This time Myriad was skinnydipping when a crisis struck resulted in major embarrassment for XcharnameX and some unfortunate media e XcharnameX posure.)
</p><p>
	Nemesis Powers include Light Control and Shadow-casting."

$aarPowLifeformControl = [
	"biophysical control" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to consciously alter the physiology of a another. S/He accomplishes this by sheer force of will and does not require any physical action on XcharnameX' part, aside from touching the target. This Power can be used at a distance but each 10 feet separating XcharnameX from the target reduces his/her effective Power by one Rank. NOTE: This Power is normally concentrated on a single target, but XcharnameX can affect as many targets as s/he desires.
</p><p>
	There are seven forms of Biophysical Control a character can choose from, each with its own set of effects. This first four forms are benevolent, the last three are malevolent. XcharnameXes who use the malevolent forms against sentient beings risk Karma and Popularity loss. When XcharnameX is created, the player must choose one of these forms. S/He can select from one of the following when modelling a character:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Healing -</em> XcharnameX can cure the damage caused by wounds, trauma, to XcharnameX ins&#039;, and disease. XcharnameX can increase the the health of another by&#039;an amount equal to his/her own Power rank. This is the  maximum benefit XcharnameX can give per day to one specific person. This Power seals the body and returns any still living tissues to health. It cannot replace lost tissue.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Regeneration -</em> XcharnameX has the ability to heal (as above) and can recreate large areas of lost tissue, such as severed limbs or destroyed organs and rare cases even brain and neural tissues.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Revival -</em> XcharnameX can actually bring the dead back to life. This Power rank number is the  maximum number of days the intended body can have been deceased and still be viable for revival by this power. The condition of the corpse determines the difficulty of the action (depth of posting required to fullfil the action). An intact, unembalmed, undecayed corpse is easier to revive then it is to revive a whole person from the desicated remains of a single eyeball (even if that eyeball was originally Wolverine). This Power begins by healing and regenerating any damage to the body, especially the cause of death. Once the body is habitable again, the Power automatically summons the deceased spirit back and reconnects it with the body. If the spirit was already reincarnated into another body, the spirit splits into identical halves. One remains with the new body while the other half returns home. If the spirit is trapped, XcharnameX can make an attempt to free said spirit based. If they can&#039;t initially free the spirit, they are aware of where the spirit is being held. And until the spirit returns, the body will remain in a comatose state awaiting the return of it' spirit.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Damage Transferral -</em> XcharnameX can heal another by apparently taking that damage from the victim and moving it into CN. This Power first heals the target; the manner is the same as for Healing (above). Simultaneously, XcharnameX' body reshapes itself into a duplication of the damage being healed. Once the target is healed, XcharnameX' Self-Healing abilities (same rank) then cures this ersatz damage. S/He cannot heal another person until s/he has returned to normal.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Decay -</em> XcharnameX can accelerate the cellular collapse of body tissue. This Power can cause Power rank damage per turn. This target becomes leprous, dies, and quickly crumbles to dust if the Power is used long enough.
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Disruption -</em> This Power can upset the Smooth functioning of the physiology. This target suffers Power rank losses to his/her health as s/he suffers anything from minor discomfort (nausea, chills) to fatal trauma (coronary attack).
		</li>
		<li>
			<em>Aging -</em> This Power can accelerate or reverse the aging process. This normal rate is multiplied by the his/her Power rank number. As the victim' age changes, physiology and mental capacities change as well. While the Power can function as a Fountain of Youth, it can also be used to kill through old age or regression to protoplasm.</li>
	</ul>

</p><p>
	<em>NOTE:</em> A target can be protected from unwanted Biophysical Control by such Powers as Force Field Generation and True Invulnerability.</p>",


	"bio-vampirism" => "<p>XcharnameX is a super-carnivore able to increase his/her Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and Power ranks by consuming living biological materials. This most common examples of Bio-Vampires are the traditional bloodsuckers like Dracula. For the uninitiated, the Blade Movies are part of the Marvel Movie-verse.
</p><p>
	Bio-Vampires may also have an additional Bonus Power of Mind Control/Puppetry or something similiar to that which renders their victims unable to physically struggle against the Bio-Vampire. However, the victim' Psyche remains uncontrolled; the victim continues to try to resist the Bio-Vampire' attack.</p>",


	"body transformation (Others)" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter the nature of elements and compounds within a living target' body. Innate safeguards in the Power maintain the target' lifeforce for as long as the target is in the altered state. Such states are not necessarily mobile, but if they are, they may require the target to move in new ways. While in a solid altered state, the target retains his/her overall normal appearance. If liquid or gaseous, s/he can assume any shape but can still automatically revert to his/her original shape when the Power' effects end. When transforming a target, XcharnameX normally changes the entire body unless the player states beforehand which specific section s/he is changing. This safeguards still take effect, but the target loses sensation in the affected areas. Transformations can take any of three basic forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Chemical This target' chemical makeup is changed to other chemicals.</li>
		<li>Physiological: This target' basic life functions are changed. This target may be changed to animal, plant, or a different chemical basis.</li>
		<li>Energy: This solid target is converted to a coherent energy field.</li>
	<p>
		<em>NOTE:</em> If creating an OC, the player decides the form of change in which XcharnameX specializes.</p>",


	"emotion control" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter a target' emotional state and resulting activity by forcing him/her to feel a particular emotion. XcharnameX can only instill one emotion at a time. However, s/he can select any emotion s/he desires. This Power affects everyone within its range. This Power is an e XcharnameX cellent choice when XcharnameX is facing adversaries more numerous and powerful than s/he is. If an opponent has a Power that is triggered by a specific mindset, such as the way Bruce Banner used to turn into the Hulk when s/he was angered, this Power can be used either to prevent that Power from taking hold or to trigger it prematurely.</p>",


	"exorcism" => "<p>XcharnameX can release a being from any external domination imposed by a third party. Such controls include Possession, Mental Domination, Serial Immortality, and Magic. If there' a control, this Power can break it by comparing XcharnameX Power rank to that of the Power controlling the subject. Upon severing the being' control over the subject, that being is immediately teleported to its home dimension. XcharnameX must be within 10&#039; of the subject in order to perform the E XcharnameX orcism. XcharnameX can use this Power to resist the initial attempt by another to control him/her, but if this attempt fails, s/he cannot E XcharnameX orcise him/herself later.</p>",


	"force field vs. hostiles" => "<p>XcharnameX emits a psionic aura that repels any hostile lifeforms. This Power automatically probes the minds of anyone in the area and analyzes their intentions toward CN. Anything harmful is repulsed, as if a Power rank material strength wall had risen between them. Neutral or friendly life is not affected by this field.
</p><p>
	Okay, I hear you asking: &#34;What if somebody starts out friendly, but turns hostile after s/he' inside the field?&#34;This answer is, s/he' catapulted harmlessly out of the field. Rank determines the size and material strength of the field. Appropriate ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. This field can be breacs/hed by several means. Brute force always works. Mental Invisibility allows someone to bypass the field' sorting ability. This field is ineffective against cybernetic life. This field protects XcharnameX from melee weapons or slugfest, but not from projected or missile weapons.</p>",


	"forced reincarnation" => "<p>XcharnameX can capture disembodied spirits and merge them into new bodies. This spirits can be the newly-dead, ghosts, or Free Spirits. This bodies. can be anythingnewborn infants, clones, androids, robots, animals, or plants. Because of the Power' interference, the reincarnated person retains his/her full memories and Mental Powers. This spirit is permanently bonded to the new body for as long as that body lives, unless the bond is deliberately broken by the spirit (a red Psyche FEAT) or by a s/he with E XcharnameX orcism Power (L5). XcharnameX can indefinitely hold the spirit in stasis (one Typical Intensity FEAT per day should be sufficient) while seeking a suitable body into which s/he can transplant the soul. If XcharnameX fails a FEAT, s/he has a few minutes in which to implant the spirit or lose it forever. XcharnameX cannot transplant the spirit into a living, intelligent being-with two notable e XcharnameX ceptions. As noted earlier, spirits can be placed within newborn infants. XcharnameX can also accept the spirit into him/herself; the result is XcharnameX now has a complete second person living in his/her s/head. This player now has to redo his/her character so as to reflect the secondary set of characteristics for Reason, Intuition, and Psyche. When a character is reincarnated into a body, s/he retains his/her abilities of Reason, Intuition, and Psyche, and any Mental Talents and Powers. Physical abilities, secondary characteristics, Physical Powers and Talents, and Contacts are all lost. Contacts can be quickly regained by convincing the Contacts of who s/he really is (a Remarkable Intensity FEAT). Karma awards should depend on how well XcharnameX has handled the spiritual transplant.</p>",


	"grafting" => "<p>This is the single most likely candidate for raw abuse and grossing people out, and should not be selected without first petitioning the AST or ST of our site. This Power is strictly Mad Scientist material. (it does have its good side, too, though.) XcharnameX can perform psionically augmented surgery on a subject. XcharnameX can operate on, dissect, rearrange, and perform transplants without the need for normal medical-techniques to ensure success. No matter how crude the conditions in which the operation is performed or how messy it proves to be, the subject' lifeforce is preserved. There is no major blood loss nor is there any need for e XcharnameX tensive recuperation. This Power is strongly related to the Healing forms of Bio-Physical control and can be used to cure others of physical damage. Unfortunately, the Power lends itself to abuse. Those possessing this Power tend more toward Doctor Frankenstein than Doctor Schweitzer. Such characters might see people as machines to be rearranged at their whim. This Power permits the character to perform acts beyond 20thcentury medical science (like brain transplants). If two or more brains are combined, the resulting character shows traits of both.</p>",


	"hypnotic control" => "<p>While generally considered more of a talent then an actual power,CN can dominate a target' behavior and actions by implanting commands, not by direct psionic control. This Hypnotic command may pertain to current conditions or lie dormant until triggered by future conditions (post-hypnotic suggestion). Hypnotic controls come in two forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Commands alter current behavior. &#34;You are getting sleepy.&#34;</li>
		<li>Suggestions alter future behavior. &#34;You hate orange, rocky skin and must destroy anything with it.&#34;Normal hypnosis cannot make a person perform any action that goes against his/her sense of ethics. However, the Power of Hypnotic Control can override the target' innate sense of morality by means of a red FEAT. Less conflicting commands involve only a green FEAT. Hypnotic Control can be established by any one of a number of means. This includes specific gestures, words, songs, or devices. When modelling a character, be sure to determines which method XcharnameX uses. This Intensity and duration of a Hypnotic Control are determined by the Power rank. In the case of post-hypnotic Suggestions, duration does not include the time prior to activation of the suggestion, but only the time the suggestion is actually in force.</li>
	</ul>",


	"mind control" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to directly control a target' mind - through psionic Powers. XcharnameX completely overrides the will and perhaps even the conscious mind of the target. There are four forms of Mind Control:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Puppetry-</em>the target mind retains awareness but cannot control the body.</li>
		<li><em>Possession-</em>the target mind loses both control and consciousness.</li>
		<li><em>Negation-</em>the target mind is completely turned off; Mental Probes show that no mind exists in the target' body.</li>
		<li><em>Magnification-</em>This target mind is actually enhanced. This rank of the target' Reason, Intuition, and/or Psyche can be temporarily increased, up to XcharnameX' Power rank. This Power rank determines the Intensity of XcharnameX' control, the range at which s/he can establish and maintain that control, and the duration of the control.</li>
	</ul>",


	"mind transferal" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to switch minds from one body to another. XcharnameX' own mind and body need not be included in any switching that occurs. This Power operates much like Mental Duplication, in that XcharnameX reshapes the brains of his/her targets to conform to those s/he is switching. In effect, the target believes s/he is the switcs/hed mind and thus effectively is that new person. This accuracy of such transfers is 100%. Because of the nature of this Power, XcharnameX can also transfer one mind into several people simultaneously, with each believing s/he is the real person. Transferral switcs/hes mental abilities, Talents, and mental Powers. Physical Powers are not transferred, nor are physical abilities, Popularity, Resources, or Contacts. This Power rank determines the range at which the Power can initially function and the duration of its effects. Ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. Duration is given for a single mind-to-mind transfer. If XcharnameX attempts to transfer one mind to multiple bodies, the duration decreases -2CS for each additional body.</p>",


	"neural manipulation" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter a target' neural activity. By changing nerve messages within the target' body, XcharnameX can cause a variety of effects.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Disruption -</em> This target' body loses all sensations; it falls to the ground, a limp, aumb mass of flesh.</li>
		<li><em>Paralysis -</em> This target body becomes completely rigid. No chemical can counteract the paralysis while the Power is in effect.</li>
		<li><em>Seizure -</em> This target' muscles spasm uncontrollably for as long as the Power is in effect.</li>
		<li><em>E XcharnameX aggeration -</em> Nerve signals are actually amplified, causing the target to overact when attempting any movement. Normally, a s/he can select any of these effects.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	This Power normally affects only a single person; affecting more causes a decrease in duration of -1CS per additional person. This target' mind and senses are unaffected by the Power; the victim knows full well what is happening (even if s/he doesn&#039;t know why it' happening to him/her). This Power can reach across the dimensional barriers if it is combined with some way of breaching the dimensions. It can function normally if both s/he and target are within another dimension.</p>",


	"plague carrier" => "<p>XcharnameX can contain within his/her body and release at will a variety of disease-causing microorganisms (bacteria, germs, viruses). XcharnameX is immune to any disease (otherwise XcharnameX have died as soon as s/he gained this dubious Power) but s/he can instantly infect others at will with diseases of his/her choosing. Symptoms appear quickly. Curiously, victims are not themselves contagious to others. Obviously the Power alters the genetics of the disease causing organisms and weakens them so that they can only survive within XcharnameX and the first new body into which they are introduced. Upon the death of the victim or the end of the Power' duration, all the microbes die as well. This Power does have a beneficial side. Because of XcharnameX' special ability to control microbas, s/he can actually cure others of disease. XcharnameX can draw out of the target' body every last microbe of a particular type. Note: this only removes the cause of damage. It does not remove the effects of the disease. example: Black Plague has a fondness for red-haired children, and cures a copper-haired tyke of smallpo XcharnameX. While the child will live, s/he still has the pockmarks. A character with this Power has to gain diseases, much as others would gain weapons, as s/he progresses. New characters begin with diseases common to everyday life, like chicken po XcharnameX. mumps, influenza, and such. This character must actively seek out sources of new diseases in order to add them to his/her inner armory. This is done by consuming live cultures (&#34;I don&#039;t get it! Why would anyone drink a vial of smallpo XcharnameX culture?&#34;) or by curing a diseased person in the manner e XcharnameX plained earlier. This latter act will gain even the vilest villain a small flock of devoted people, all cured by him/her. XcharnameX can use his/her Power against single targets. Multiple targets decrease his/her Power rank by -1CS per ad ‘ ditional person. Rank determines the Intensity of the infection and duration of the symptoms. This Power can be negated or even destroyed by Ll/Biophysical Control or massive injections of anti-microbial drugs. XcharnameX is then reduced to a normal being. This Power' ability to infect others can be negated by normal medical means or Powers like Self-Healing, Induced Healing, True Invulnerability, and this Power itself.</p>",


	"plant control" => "<p>XcharnameX can impart limited movement and self-awareness to normally unintelligent plants. This plants obey simple commands, and possess rudimentary communication and senses. XcharnameX can accelerate the plants&#039; growth somewhat, but cannot make it e XcharnameX ceed normal limits on size or shape. Rank determines the number of plants affected and the duration of the control. E XcharnameX ceeding the number of controlled plants decreases the duration -1CS per additional 10%. Controlled plants have their own characteristics and ranks that are increased to XcharnameX' Power rank, ws/here applicable.</p>",


	"plant growth " => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to make plants grow nearly instantaneously, and far larger than normal. This Power can force a seed to sprout immediately and gives it the ability to thrive, even in the absence of normal nutrients (light, soil, and water). XcharnameX can affect existing plants and seeds or use seeds and sprouts carried with him/her. In the latter case, the player must make a list of the types of seeds XcharnameX carries oust as a weapons specialist needs a list of those with which s/he is proficient). This Power does not change the natural abilities of the affected plants; it only enhances them up to the Power' rank. This Power requires the player to develop some rudimentary knowledge of botany, since the more the player knows about plants, the more stunts XcharnameX can perform. Typical plants used with this Power are:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Poison ivy</strong> - rash incapacitates foes</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Kudzu</strong> - vines entangle targets</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Briar</strong> - forms impassable barriers</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Goldenrod</strong> - hayfever city...</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Oak</strong> - instant support for damaged buildings</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Venus flytrap</strong> - Catch and hold foes</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Power rank determines the speed of plant growth and the rank of the affected plant' abilities. Growing a plant in normal conditions (adequate light, soil, and water) requires a Typical Intensity.FEAT. Growing plants in less than adequate conditions (insufficient light, soil, or water; typical urban conditions) requires a Remarkable hostile conditions (no light, soil, or water) requires an Unearthly Intensity FEAT. Because their metabolism is accelerated by this Power, the plants quickly die. This lifespan is 1/8 normal. As a rule of thumb, the player can use these guidelines for normal and accelerated lifespans: House plants-6 months/2 days Shrubbery-5 years/3 weeks Trees-1 00- 1000 years/1 -10 years This point of this is that your s/he doesn&#039;t have to worry about filling the city with giant plants left over from old battles. S/He might still be in trouble with the Park Department, though...</p>",


	"sense alteration" => "<p>XcharnameX can deliberately change the manner in whic a target either receives sensory stimuli processes it within the brain. This simplest form negates one or more of the senses, producing instant blindness, deafness, numbness, and so on. More comple XcharnameX is the ability to modify the senses. XcharnameX can amplify some elements and negate others. For example, XcharnameX might make a target literall see red (and only red). This most comple XcharnameX form is Hallucinations. By a Monstrous Intensity FEAT, XcharnameX can transfer sensory informatic to others, making everyone share a corr mon set of perceptions. Thisse may be XcharnameX', or someone else'. Sensory negation takes a Typical Intensity FEAT; sensory alteration takes a Remarkable Intensity FEAT. This Power rank determines the range and duration of the effects.</p>",


	"shape alteration" => "<p>Others: XcharnameX has the ability to change the shapes of other living beings. This result can take any shape and appearance XcharnameX wiss/hes: animal, vegetable, mineral. This target' basic physiology remains unchanged despite the apparent differences between the original and new forms. When Shapechanging a target, XcharnameX must make sure that the new form still allows basic life functions to continue (especially breathing!). If not, using the Power constitutes a Kill result and all that bad Karma entailed therein. When creating CN, the player can opt to e XcharnameX change one of his/her randomly generated Powers for L2/Body Transformation-Others. In this case XcharnameX really can change a living target int anything s/he wants (with no restrictions).</p>",


	"sleep" => "<p>Induced: this is a nice, simple, straight-forward Power that is hardly ever used in any comic because it' not terribly dramatic. Nor is it e XcharnameX actly cricket. XcharnameX has the ability to put any target into a deep sleep, from which s/he cannot awake while the Power is in effect. During this induced sleep, the target is completely s/helpless (see what I mean about not being cricket?). On the other hand, when you&#039;re facing 325 battle-crazed Skrulls, this Power can be really handy. This Power rank determines the range and duration of the Power. Relevant distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. It affects everyone within range. Sleep persists for 1 -10 hours after the Power' duration. During that time, the victim can be awakened by anyone, but s/he&#039;ll wake up naturally in any case.</p>",


	"spirit storage" => "<p>XcharnameX can capture and indefinitely hold within him/herself any number of disembodied spirits. Such spirits find themselves within a pocket dimension of XcharnameX' creation; while within it, they retain a semblance to their original forms. This pocket dimension can have any appearance. This one within Adam Warlock' Soulgem was a rather pleasant park. XcharnameX can freely communicate with any spirits s/held within. S/He is immune to any attempts they might make to possess his/her body. A spirit can escape on a red Psyche FEAT, provided its Psyche rank is higs/her than the Power rank. This Power can be used in conjunction with L6/Forced Reincarnation to find new homes for vagrant spirits. This Power can be mechanically simulated to provide a &#34;holding tank&#34;for disruptive spirits like poltergeists or particularly malevolent Free Spirits. In this case, the Power lasts as long as the device is supplied with energy. Capturing a spirit requires a FEAT. Compare the Power rank with the Psyche of the intended target. If the Power rank is higs/her, a green FEAT will do. Equal ranks require a yellow FEAT. A Psyche rank higs/her than the Power rank means XcharnameX must make a red FEAT.</p>",


	 "summoning" => "<p>XcharnameX can summon and control extra-dimensional, corporeal beings. Such beings are commonly called &#34;demons&#34;but may be of any nature or disposition. This Power enables XcharnameX to summon any known extra-dimensional being, Provided his/her Power rank is higs/her than the being' Psyche rank, on a green FEAT. Equal ranks require a yellow FEAT. Trust me, you don&#039;t want to summon beings more powerful than you (they might answer), but if you do it anyway, you need a red FEAT. This summoned being is instantly teleported from its home dimension to a spot chosen by CN. Once summoned, the being must perform a single task ordered by CN. being must immediately set about fulfilling the order. If successful, s/he can immediately depart for his/her home dimension. Normally, s/hees will only summon magical creatures like demons and elementals. If a s/he feels particularly confident, though, s/he might be able to call magical characters like Clea and D&#039;Spayre. XcharnameXes can never summon entities, although one might pretend to answer a summoning on a lark. This Power summons one being at a time. Each additional being decreases the Power' rank by -1CS. Remember that most magical beings are intelligent and that many are hostile to humans. This being a s/he summons today might hold a grudge against him/her for eons to come.</p>",


	"undead control" => "<p>XcharnameX can dominate the wills and actions of previously living, still-corporeal beings. Such beings are often called &#34;zombies&#34;or &#34;zuvembies&#34;and are only semi-intelligent. Controlling them requires a green FEAT. Controlling fully intelligent, more powerful undead like mummies or vampires may require MOD or ST approval. Once control is established, XcharnameX can order the undead to perform any task s/he desires, so long as it is within their ability. Control ceases when the task is accomplished, but can be reinstated at that time. This Power cannot affect anything alive. A cured vampire, for example, would ignore the Power."

	"reality alteration" => "<p>XcharnameX can reshape time itself in order to achieve a desired situation. There are four forms of this Power, each with a specific area of effect. Three of these alter the conditions that result from the passage of time. The fourth alters the actual flow of time. When the player creates a character with this Power, he must roll the dice to randomly determine what form his Mage possesses.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Future</li>
		<li>Present</li>
		<li>Past</li>
		<li>Temporal Flow</li>
	</ol>
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Future -</em> XcharnameX can control the probability of a certain event coming to pass. The event can have any degree of importance, from a simple coin toss to the passage of the Mutant Control Act. The larger the event, the more steps will be required to bring the desired outcome into being. (i.e., the greater importance the more difficult it is to alter). XcharnameX to make the desired change in a series of several steps over a great period of time. The Power is limited to directly influencing events within a finite range of time and comple XcharnameX ity. The  maximum range into the future that XcharnameX can directly influence events is the number of hours equal to his/her Power rank. For example, an E XcharnameX cellent rank (20) can influence an event that won&#039;t occur for another twenty hours. CN must be within line-of-sight of the location of the impending event in order to use this Power. Clairvoyance or Sensory Link can be coupled with this Power to e XcharnameX tend its range up to the limit of that Power' detection range.
</p><p>
	This Power requires a great deal of cooperation with the Mods/Storytellers of the site, especially at the higher levels that have an immediate range of several minutes or hours of game time. If the desired action is successful, the future event occurs naturally at the appointed time. If the action is unsuccessful (the Mods/Storytelers determine that it not possible and or accapetable), the event is somehow protected from XcharnameX' tampering. She must try a different tactic if she makes another attempt to alter said future event.<p>
</p><p>
	Some events appear to be too comple XcharnameX for this Power. In such a case, XcharnameX should remember the adage, &#34;From little acorns grow mighty oaks.&#34;A little timetampering today can snowball into a major rewrite of history in years to come.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Present -</em> XcharnameX can change the conditions of her present surroundings. It is as if XcharnameX had somehow altered the past without realizing it. In truth, XcharnameX has built a pocket dimension that transformed her immediate surroundings into those of a world from an alternate timeline. The world she uses is one whose natural conditions most closely matches the desired conditions. The degree of difference between the real and the borrowed world determines what Intensity FEAT is required. A world that fairly closely matches that of the Marvel Universe requires a green FEAT. A world of major historical differences but similar in biological and geological terms requires a yellow FEAT. Worlds that are drastically different, such as a New York built by intelligent lizards, require a red FEAT.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can take any number of people along to this other-world. The  maximum number is equal to the Power rank number. Anyone consciously brought along retains their original minds and memories of conditions in their native reality. Such passengers can operate freely anywhere within XcharnameX' area of control.
</p><p>
	A size of the affected region is a spherical area whose size is determined by the Power rank. The radius is the number of miles equal to the Power rank number. A curious side-effect of this Power is that the affected area can be used as a gateway to the other-world it emulates. Anyone traveling beyond the range of XcharnameX' Power is automatically transported to that real world. Fortunately they retain a link to XcharnameX that allows them to automatically return if they again enter the area represented by XcharnameX' Power. This assumes they return while XcharnameX' little world still exists; if they tarry too long they become accidental emigres to this other-world and will have to find their own way home.
</p><p>
	The actual lifespan of the pocket dimension is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time of creation. A green Reason FEAT gives a  maximum duration of two hours times the Reason rank number. A yellow Feat increases it to one day times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT increases that to ten days times the Reason rank number. In very special circumstances, XcharnameX might be able to make the duration permanent. In such a case, the pocket dimension has e XcharnameX panded to take in all of the emulated other-world. Such cases are entirely at the Mod' discretion and should be limited to e XcharnameX tremely urgent rewritings of campaign history. An example of this might be if Fabian Stankowitz had accidentally killed all the Avengers in the last gaming session.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can terminate the pocket dimension at any time, thereby returning everyone to the real world. Their locations upon returning correspond to their relative positions in the other-world. If their earlier positions had been at an altitude or depth other than ground level, upon returning they are safely deposited on a surface that most resembles their earlier position. If none is available, they are deposited at ground level.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Past -</em> XcharnameX can actually change past history and thereby really alter the present. This is the most powerful listing in the Ultimate Powers Book. As such, it will probably be forbidden to player characters e XcharnameX cept in the rarest of cases. The range at which CN can reach into past is determined by the Power rank. XcharnameX must be at the site of any past event he wants to change. His Power rank decreases -1CS for each mile it is away from the actual site. The  maximum temporal range is the number of weeks equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Shift-Y rank can reach nearly four years into the past.
</p><p>
	The difficulty of the desired change determines what Intensity rank is required. Single physical events, such as anything determined by a single die roll, can be changed by a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	Comple XcharnameX or sequential physical events or altering a single being' behavior requires a yellow FEAT. Altering the behavior of two or more beings requires a red FEAT. The reason most Judges will forbid their players to have this Power is that it requires them to rethink. the history of their Marvel campaign in terms of this alteration. Take heart in the cynical knowledge that most people' actions do not significantly alter the fabric of history. As a rule of thumb concerning common people, there is only a one-in-athousand chance that one person' changed decision will have a significant effect on history. When dealing with influential people (leaders, super beings, creative types, and so on), the probability rises to one-in-ten.
</p><p>
	<em>Note:</em> There is much debate over the true nature of tampering with the past. Is there a single timeline that is irreparably changed by each act of tampering? Are there infinite worlds and thus tampering is not only allowed but encouraged? Does the act of tampering actually catapult the tamperer into an alternate world of her own devising? The game mechanics support the last interpretation. Each Judge' Marvel campaign is set in an alternate world that more or less mirrors the published accounts of the Marvel Universe (the comic books, people). E XcharnameX tensive tampering in the past affects only the world of the tamperer and her player. Judges can even play several alternate timelines, switching among them at each gaming session.
</p><p>
	<em>Alter Time Flow -</em> XcharnameX can alter the rate at which time passes. He can accelerate or decelerate it to such a point that the affected area is apparently in stasis. The  maximum amount that time is altered is proportional to the Power rank number. Time is accelerated by its normal rate times the Power rank number. For example, a Good rank can make time pass at tenfold speed.
</p><p>
	Deceleration makes time apparently pass at arate equal to the normal rate divided by the Power rank number. For example, a Monstrous rate can stretch one minute into 75 minutes.
</p><p>
	The perception of time' passage depends on who is actually accelerated or decelerated. To an accelerated person, the world has slowed down. To a decelerated person, time has sped up. Clever Mages can really screw people up by playing on this. For example, decelerating everyone around a certain person might make that person believe that he had actually been accelerated.
</p><p>
	The Power may be used to alter either XcharnameX or another target. If it is used against another, that target is allowed to resist. Such means include Force Field vs. Magic, Resistance to Magic, and other such powers
</p><p>
	THIS POWER IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - MOD/ST APPROVAL REQUIRED</p>",


	"reality warping" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to reshape matter and energy, living or inanimate material, to create, alter or end life. In many ways XcharnameX can turn desires into reality. However unlike REALITY ALTERAION, they can not actually alter the past or the future or shape events or outcomes. While they can use their ability to warp reality so that gravity works in reverse or so that water evaporates at ten degree' below zero, they can&#34;t affect the actual actions or thoughts of another sentient being. They can bend time and space or possibly even rewrite the laws of physics but not that of the human will.
</p><p>
	THIS POWER IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - MOD/ST APPROVAL REQUIRED</p>",


	"magical fortitude" => "<p>Unlike most people, be they normal or meta, XcharnameX possesses a natural resistant to most sorceries, magics, enchantments and there inherent effects. Regardless of the magical properties of a sword or length of rope or other magical item, he is capable of resisting magical effects of said magic. However he is wholly subject to the physical aspects of such an object though regardless of its magical properites. I.E. a sword is still a sword and can cut him, a rope is still a rope and can bind him, not because of any inherent magical qualities but because it is a property of vessel which contains the magic. Thus most magical effects will not effect him, and the stronger ones will be greatly reduced regarding whatever effects they might have on him.</p>",


	"temporal control" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to control the how he or others &#34;experience&#34; the temporal continuum. This allows him to reference the temporal frame in which he or others exist so as to cause them to move faster, or slower or &#34;freezing&#34;them in time-space."
];



$aarPowMatterControl = [
	"bonding" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to join two or more targets together on a molecular level. The effect is the same as if the targets were glued or welded together. In actuality, the XcharnameX has induced molecular adhesion. A submicroscopic examination would fail to reveal any foreign material (such as a glue) or disturbances in the normal arrangement of the target' structure (such as the distortion caused by welding). The Bonding is so powerful that attempting to sever its effect results in physical damage to either of the Bonded targets because the only way to forcibly separate two Bonded objects is to tear the surface of one or both of them. This causes Typical wounds to a living target.
</p><p>
	The range for Bonding is limited to Contact only. XcharnameX need not touch the actual area to be Bonded, although the XcharnameX needs to touch the two targets somewhere in order to direct the Power' effect. Once the XcharnameX is touching both targets and has begun to manifest XcharnameX Power, Bonding occurs at any point where the two targets are in contact with each other. The Bonding process takes any number of turns, depending both on the XcharnameX' Power rank and the desired material strength of the Bonding. The first turn produces a Bonding of Feeble material strength. Each turn the Bonding process continues raises that material strength +1CS, up to the limit of the Power rank. At any point the XcharnameX can cease to use XcharnameX Power and thus produce Bondings of varied strengths.
</p><p>
	The duration of the Bonding is determined by a Power FEAT at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT creates a Bond that lasts a number of turns equal to the XcharnameX' Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT increases the multipliers to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT ensures a permanent Bonding. If the Bonding is temporary, its effects end without a trace at the e XcharnameX piration of the time limit.
</p><p>
	This is a Power that readily combines with many of the other listings in this book. Combining it with Webcasting produces an equivalent to Spiderman' web. Weapons Tinkering produces an equivalent to the Trapster' glue gun.
</p><p>
	Chemical Touch produces a natural adhesive coating on the XcharnameX' body.
</p><p>
	Combustion or Fire Generation produces napalm. There are more but I&#34;ll leave them to the player' imagination to devise.
</p><p>
	The Power can only affect solids.
</p><p>
	Liquid, gaseous, ethereal, and Phasing matter are immune to this Power' effects. Once Bonded, matter cannot Phase as a means of escaping the adhesion; doing so causes Typical damage as the Bonded surface is lett behind. Transition from solid to either liquid or gaseous state will work to free the Bonded matter without physical damage, although this is not an option for most people.
</p><p>
	Bonding only occurs on the surface and does not penetrate more than 1/1 6th of an inch into any Bonded material.
</p><p>
	The effect this has on living targets is that only the epidermis is affected. As it does not affect liquids, the Power automatically penetrates any coating that might otherwise protect the target.</p>",


	"collection" => "<p>XcharnameX can cause any desired. material to collect in a specific location. This material must already be present and diffused throughout the XcharnameX' vicinity, whether in the air, water, soil, or scattered across the ground. The Collection area has a radius determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column C of the Range Table inside this book' cover. For example, an Incredible rank can collect material from as far as 25 miles away.
</p><p>
	Collected material instantly teleports to the designated Collection site. The site must be in line of sight of the XcharnameX and within XcharnameX Power' range. XcharnameX can Collect per turn a  maximum amount of material measured in the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number.
</p><p>
	This assumes, of course, that enough material exists within the vicinity in order to be Collected. Any material of any nature can be Collected. There is a partial e XcharnameX emption to this rule in regards to living beings. The Power can only Collect living beings whose weight is within the weight limits for the Power; if the beings weighs more, the Power can not affect them aside from a brief tug. If the Power is used to Collect the bodily products of living beings, player and Judges are to assume that so little is drawn from each being that no harm results. For example, a character could Collect a mass of blood without having to worry that XcharnameX bled some stranger to death.
</p><p>
	The Power does not after the state of any matter either before or after Collection. The desired matter must be in the basic chemical formulation desired.
</p><p>
	Desired materials that are in some altered state are not affected by the Power. For example, trying to Collect steel in a junkyard full of rust will lead to naught. The exceptionis if the desired material is in either a state of solution or suspension, since neither actually affects the chemical nature of the material.
</p><p>
	For example, imagine your XcharnameX is standing at the seaside and practicing XcharnameX Power. XcharnameX cannot Collect the hydrogen bound into the water but XcharnameX could Collect salt, gold, or anything else dissolved into seawater. Collecting salt is easy; a Remarkable Power can Collect a mansized pile within a minute' time. Gold is harder; each cubic mile of seawater contains only a few ounces of gold.
</p><p>
	Due to some une XcharnameX plained limitation to this Power, it cannot randomly Collect foreign materials found within the bodies of anyone within the Power' range.
</p><p>
	Common foreign materials include tooth fillings, prostheses, sutures, and drugs.
</p><p>
	If the XcharnameX must Collect such materials from a body.
</p><p>
	Ethereal and Phasing matter can be Collected. They just can&#34;t be held for any length of time without consciously and repeatedly using the Power to return such matter to the Collection site.
</p><p>
	This Power is most commonly linked to the Matter Control and Conversion Powers as a way to gather sufficient raw material to permit the other Powers to function. These are listed as Optional Powers. Even if used by itself, this Power can be used effectively. Matter can be Collected to form a protective shield or to entrap a foe in a suddenly appearing pile of debris. Dirt or water can be Collected to smother a fire or dampen escaping radiation. XcharnameX is free to develop various Power Stunts using suddenly materialized matter.
</p><p>
	The comple XcharnameX ity of the material to be collected determines what Intensity FEAT is required. Raw, amorphous materials can be collected in a dusty pile by a green FEAT. Common examples include metals, dirt, and water. Formed or comple XcharnameX material requires a yellow FEAT to collect in recognizable form. examples include bricks, edibles, and comic books.
</p><p>
	Biological material requires a red FEAT, whether the XcharnameX is trying to collect bile or hamsters.</p>",


	"crystallization" => "<p>XcharnameX can transform any target material into a gemlike material that possesses Power rank material strength. Crystallization occurs because the XcharnameX has the ability to shape the molecular bonds of normally amorphous matter into a crystal matri XcharnameX of great strength. The Crystallization can occur at any site within the XcharnameX' line of sight and range; distances are determined by the Power rank and can be found on column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The newlyformed Crystal is initially stationary; it cannot be launched like a missile (unless the XcharnameX possesses Missile Creation, but I&#34;m getting ahead of myself). It can be formed in such a position that gravity immediately affects it.
</p><p>
	Crystallization automatically affects non-living, unprotected, stationary targets. Moving targets require the XcharnameX to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. If Crystallization is used as an attack against a living target, it can be resisted by the usual methods. Methods of protecting a target from being Crystallized include Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, and various Magics and Power Controls.
</p><p>
	Crystal can be formed in any shape the XcharnameX desires. The amount of Crystal the XcharnameX can create in a single turn is the number of square feet equal to the Power rank number. The material to be transformed into Crystal is drawn from particles in the air or from the target itself. Solid targets can themselves be Crystallized. If the Power is used on a living target, innate safeguards incorporated into the Power place the target into a semi-state of Suspended Animation; all life functions temporarily cease but the target remains aware of its condition and surroundings. A Crystallized lifeform must remain intact if the process is to be reversed. If the Crystallized lifeform is shattered, the transformation is permanent. <em>Note:</em> the shards-of a shattered, Crystallized lifeform all possess some of the victim' lifeforce; the percentage of the victim' Psyche possessed by a particular shard is equal to the percentage of the original body represented by the shard. Such shards can be used to create powerful Magic. Such shards can also lead to later Plot Complications. (&#34;You don&#34;t understand. The gem in the necklace I gave Helen was part of Leviathan!) Normally Crystallization is only temporary. The duration of a given Crystal is the number of minutes equal to the Power rank number. At the e XcharnameX piration of this time, the Crystal reverts back to its original material. If the Crystallization was directed in the air the original material was probably dust particles. As mentioned earlier, if the Crystallization was used to transform a living target and that Crystal was subsequently shattered, the transformation is made permanent.
</p><p>
	(This rule is purposefully intended to spare the Judge and players from dealing with the hamburger that would be created if the formerly living target did revert to its original state.) For game purposes, the category of &#34;living target can be e XcharnameX panded by the Judge to encompass any of the Physical Types for player characters and NPCs.
</p><p>
	The Power can be combined with other Powers listed in this book. As mentioned before, Missiles can give the Crystals momentum and range. Weapons Creation can specialize in crystalline instruments of destruction. Body Armor or Body Coating can be a suit of fle XcharnameX ible crystalline armor with that gives Power rank Resistance to physical or energy attacks. Vision-based Detection Powers can be achieved by the XcharnameX spontaneously forming optical devices and lenses of crystal. If the XcharnameX has an e XcharnameX otic Physical Type, perhaps XcharnameX can XcharnameX be composed of living crystal.
</p><p>
	Such categories include Modified Humans, Cyborgs, Robots, Abnormal Chemistry, Mineral, Compound, and Changeling.</p>",


	"diminution" => "<p>XcharnameX can reduce the size of a target. The target must be in line of sight and within one area of the XcharnameX. Any material can be Diminished by this Power With the sole exceptionof material that has already been Diminished by an equal or higher rank of this Power. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Diminished to a further point than the XcharnameX could reach anyway.
</p><p>
	The level to which the XcharnameX can Diminish a target is determined by the Power rank. Levels appropriate to this Power are - .

</p><p>
	In practical terms, a Diminishment rank of Shift XcharnameX. Y, or Z is sufficient to reduce a normal-sized human to the size of a cell. Either CL1000 or CL3000 will reduce him to atomic scale. CL5000 reduces a human to such a point where XcharnameX can enter a Microverse such as Jarella' world of Kaa.
</p><p>
	<em>A note on Microverses:</em> These are miniature dimensions that can be reached by a person undergoing e XcharnameX treme size reduction. The act of Shrinking causes the person to breach the Dimensional Barriers and reach a chosen Microverse. The worlds within a Microverse roughly correspond to but are not actually atoms or molecules. Once within a Microverse, the Dimension traveler finds XcharnameX in an environment that appro XcharnameX imates conditions in the larger, outer world. Microverses may themselves contain even smaller Microverses. Even our own world may in fact be a Microverse to some inconceivably larger Macroverse.
</p><p>
	The duration of Diminution on a target is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used on the target. A green Reason FEAT gives a duration of the Reason rank number times 100 turns. A yellow FEAT increase this to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the diminution permanent; in such a case the only way the target can return to its original size is through use of Enlargement, Magic, or Power Negation.
</p><p>
	There are three very different ways to create the effect of Diminution. Each has its own mechanism and peculiar properties as a result of that mechanism. The player can either choose for XcharnameX or let a random die roll determine which form.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Collapse -</em> XcharnameX decreases the distance between the target' atoms and subatomic particles. The target does not lose weight as it shrinks. Rather, it becomes increasingly dense and could eventually collapse into neutronium (CL3000 Diminution) or even a black hole (CL5000 Diminution). Strength is unaffected by the change in size but leverage becomes increasingly difficult at smaller sizes.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Reduction -</em> XcharnameX decreases the number of atoms in the target' body.
</p><p>
	The lost matter is either disintegrated (if the Diminution is permanent) or temporarily removed from the target' plane of existence and stored on another plane until it is needed to return the target to its original size. Mass and strength both decrease as the target Shrinks; the lower ranks are proportional to the target' new size. The target becomes increasingly simple in structure and reach a stage where the remaining structure is too simple to sustain the lifeforce of a living target. This occurs at Shift XcharnameX rank. If the Diminution is temporary, the target' lifeforce is stored on the same plane as the displaced matter that normally forms XcharnameX body. At Shift Z Diminution, the target consists of only a single molecule which immediately vanishes when the ne XcharnameX t rank is reached.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Reduction -</em>This is the most common form of Diminution and the only form that permits the target to enter a Microverse. XcharnameX can reduce the size of the atoms and subatomic particles themselves, thus reducing the overall size in a proportional manner.
</p><p>
	Mass and physical strength are reduced a proportional amount. While this Power has more advantages than the other forms, it has a deadly disadvantage. As the target' atoms shrink, they are no longer able to interact with other, normal sized atoms. As a result, a living target is unable to breathe the air or consume food or water. Seen in this light, this form of Diminution is the equivalent of a Fatal attack. Fortunately, there is a 95% chance the Power envelopes the target in an energy field that shrinks anything within one foot (proportional to the target' current size) of the target to the same size as the target. This allows the target to breathe, drink, and eat. The existence of this field is randomly determined at the time the source of the Diminution is created. If the XcharnameX lacks such field, then any target must have its own supply of proportionally-sized consumables. Even non-living targets can be affected in that the Power effectively insulates them from electricity, since normal-sized electrons cannot flow into a Diminished conductor. Treat this as rank level Resistance to Electricity. If the field exists, electrons are automatically Shrunken to permit conductivity.
</p><p>
	It is assumed that when the Power is used, the XcharnameX intends to Diminish the entire target. If the XcharnameX specifies, XcharnameX can attempt to shrink only part of a target.
</p><p>
	Since this is equivalent to tearing the target apart, a Power FEAT determined by the Material Strength of the target is required to do such an act.
</p><p>
	example - Sizemaster has possesses Remarkable Diminution. Seeing an uproar at XcharnameX local bank, XcharnameX wanders in to see what' up. XcharnameX discovers The Shocker trying desperately to free people trapped in a safe and XcharnameX decides to assist the rescue. XcharnameX locates a section of the safe away from The Shocker and begins to manifest XcharnameX Power. The safe is made of steel and reinforced concrete and has a Remarkable Material Strength.
</p><p>
	Good, Sizemaster only needs to make a yellow FEAT to Diminish a hatch in the safe' wall. Within twelve seconds XcharnameX has Diminished a si XcharnameX -foot-wide area into a one-inch-wide plug, which drops out of the wall and rolls around on the floor.
</p><p>
	Sizemaster is helping the trapped people out of the safe when Shocker finally burns through the opposite wall. Later the two rivals seal the hole Sizemaster made by holding the plug in place as returned to its original size.
</p><p>
	The Power can automatically effect a non-living, stationary, unprotected target.
</p><p>
	Moving targets require the XcharnameX to make an Agility FEAT to hit the target with XcharnameX Power. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power' effects in the same way they would resist any energy attack Targets can be protected from Diminution by such Powers as Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, and the simultaneous use of an opposing Enlargement Power. Atomic Dispersal opposes Atomic Collapse, Atomic Gain opposes Atomic Reduction, and Atomic Growth opposes Atomic Shrinkage. If the opponent lacks the matching form of Enlargement XcharnameX can still try to negate the effects of Diminution with whatever form XcharnameX possesses; the results can get a little weird, though.</p>",


	"disruption" => "<p>XcharnameX can destroy a target' physical structure without resorting to a physical or overt energy attack. The molecular bonds that give a target its solidity are directly Disrupted, with the result that the target collapses into dust, sand, liquid, or even vapor.
</p><p>
	The Material Strength of the target determines what Intensity FEAT is required. For example, asphalt has Good Material Strength and consequently would require a Good Intensity FEAT to destroy.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can Disrupt any target within both line-of-sight and range. The range is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The amount of matter the XcharnameX can Disrupt in a single turn is the number of pounds equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. If the player chooses when creating the character, XcharnameX can increase either range or amount affected any number of +CS by decreasing the other factor an equal number of -CS.
</p><p>
	example - an initial rank of Good can be altered by up to 3CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (Contact only) and Incredible effect (40 pounds) or Incredible range (11 areas) and Feeble effect (two pounds).
</p><p>
	Also when creating the character, the player can choose whether to make the Disruption permanent or temporary.
</p><p>
	Choosing the temporary option raises the Power rank +1CS. The duration of the Disruption is determined by a separate Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives a duration equal to 100 turns times the Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns time the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the Disruption permanent. At the e XcharnameX piration of the duration, the Disrupted matter reforms in its original shape although not necessarily in its original location. If the target is living, the Power has the peculiar;r effect of placing the target in a state of semi-Suspended Animation. All life function cease for the duration but the target somehow retains consciousness and awareness.
</p><p>
	This Power is often incorporated into weapons systems. A Disruptor Gun can be designed and built by a Reason rank and an e XcharnameX penditure of Resource points equal to the Power rank desired for the weapon.
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by the Power. Moving targets require the XcharnameX to make an Agility FEAT in order to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist the Power in the same manner they could resist any energy attack.
</p><p>
	Targets can be protected from Disruption by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, a combination of Collection and Molding, certain Magics, and certain Power Controls. Any of these can reduce the Intensity of the Disruption by the opposing Power' rank. The Judge is free to decide for XcharnameX the results of partial protection from Disruption.</p>",


	"enlargement" => "<p>XcharnameX can increase the size of any target. The target can be of any nature and must be within both line-of-sight and one area of the XcharnameX' location. Any material can be enlarged with one e XcharnameX ception; the Power cannot affect any target that has already been Enlarged by another Power of equal or greater rank. In such a case, the would-be target is assumed to already be Enlarged past any point the XcharnameX could have Enlarged it to anyway.
</p><p>
	The amount the XcharnameX can Enlarge a target is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	The levels to which the XcharnameX can Enlarge a target are shown below:
</p><p>
	Resultant size Rank ( XcharnameX original size) </p>
<ul>
	<li>
		FE 1.5 XcharnameX </li>

	<li>
		CL3000 1,000 XcharnameX </li>
	<li>
		CL5000 10,000 XcharnameX </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
	The duration of the Enlargement is determined by a Reason FEAT made at the time the Power is used. A green FEAT gives the Enlargement a duration of 100 turns times the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason number. A red FEAT makes the Enlargement permanent.
</p><p>
	There are three different mechanisms by which Enlargement can occur. Each form has a different set of innate properties. When creating the character, the player must decide which form the XcharnameX has. The player can either select one or let the dice randomly determine it for him.
</p><p>
	Die Roll Form 01-30 Atomic Dispersal 31-60 Atomic Growth 61-00 Atomic Gain Atomic Dispersal - The Power causes the spaces between the atoms and subatomic particles to increase, thus increasing overall size. Mass remains the same despite any increase in size, causing the target' density to drop.
</p><p>
	Material Strength decreases -1CS with each doubling in size. Eventually, at Shift XcharnameX Enlargement a solid target reaches a stage where it is less dense than air and can drift off. At Class 1000 rank and beyond, the target becomes effectively intangible to contact with normal matter.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Gain -</em> The Power causes the target to gain additional atoms. These are automatically incorporated into the target to duplicate and augment existing molecular structures. As the targets gains new atoms, the size and mass of the target increase proportionally.
</p><p>
	Where do the new atoms come from? There are three possibilities. One theory holds that Molecular Creation creates them from the XcharnameX' force of will. A second theory suggests Molecular and Elemental Conversion are responsible; the new atoms are simply Converted air molecules. The third e XcharnameX planation is that the XcharnameX somehow taps into another dimension, one that contains nothing but the raw material for this Power and the Matter Creation Powers and also provides a storage place for the matter displaced by Shrinking, Diminution, and Disintegration. This last idea could lead to a Plot Complication wherein the XcharnameX accidentally draws something More than raw material from that unknown dimension.
</p><p>
	I&#039;ll leave it to you to decide which e XcharnameX planation you accept as the truth.
</p><p>
	As the target e XcharnameX pands, it gains real strength sufficient to move its new mass.
</p><p>
	Real strength increases +1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement the target is e XcharnameX posed to.
</p><p>
	example - The Power is used on a normal adult si XcharnameX feet in height, 200 pounds in weight, and possessing Typical Strength: </p>

</ul>
</p><p>
	The target' other Primary and Secondary Abilities remain unaffected. The disadvantages of great size negate the advantages. However, Health seems to increase because physical attacks do less relative damage. For example, a single bullet could kill a normal sized person but would be little more than a high-velocity grain of sand to a giant. The damage done by Physical Attacks decreases -1CS for each +2CS of Enlargement. Note: the damage that didn&#34;t affect the giant might be fatal when XcharnameX reverts to normal size. Wounds shrink but bullets do not.
</p><p>
	<em>Atomic Growth -</em>The target' atoms and subatomic particles actually increase in size, thus increasing the target' overall size. Mass increases proportionally. The target' Strength increases only enough to match XcharnameX greater weight; Lifting Strength does not increase. There is a dangerous drawback to this form of Enlargement. As the target' atoms grow, they become unable to interact with normal atoms. The result is that the target is unable to breathe, drink, or eat. Fortunately there is a 95% chance that the Power envelops the target in an energy field that enlarges any atoms within its effect to the same scale as the target. The existence of this field must be determined at the time the XcharnameX is created. If the field is not present, the target must have a proportionallysized supply of consumables or this Power is considered a Fatal attack. The lack of the field has one advantage in that Electricity cannot flow between normalsized and Enlarged conductors. The Power thus provides rank level Resistance to Electricity.
</p><p>
	It is always assumed that the XcharnameX intends to Enlarge the entire target' body. If the XcharnameX intends to Enlarge a specific area of a target, XcharnameX must make a special effort to do so. Since this has the effect of tearing the target apart, the XcharnameX must make a Power FEAT based on the Material Strength of the target. For example, a brick wall has Good Material Strength. A XcharnameX with Typical Enlargement would need to make a red FEAT to enlarge a specific section of the wall, while a XcharnameX with an Incredible rank would only have to make a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	The effects-on the entire target if only a section of it is Enlarged vary by case and by degree of Enlargement. The most common result of a section of Enlarged matter surrounded by normal matter is that one of the two sections shattered, depending on which is the weaker section. Atomic Dispersal weakens Material Strength, Atomic Growth doesn&#34;t alter it, and Atomic Gain increases it.
</p><p>
	Judges should use this guide and their imagination to decide the results of specific Enlargement.
</p><p>
	The Power automatically affects stationary, non-living, unprotected targets. Moving targets require the XcharnameX to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any Energy Attack.
</p><p>
	Targets can be protected from Enlargement by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, Certain Magics and Power Controls, and any of the Shrinking or Diminution Powers used simultaneously to the Enlarging attack.
</p><p>
	The opposing forms of these are Collapse vs. Dispersal, Reduction vs.
</p><p>
	Gain, and Shrinkage vs. Growth. Only the matching form can completely protect a target from unwanted Enlargement; while the other two will apparently work, the final result can be a little weird if e XcharnameX treme ranks of Power are employed.</p>",


	"geoforce" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect and control geological forces. These include plate movement, stress, faults, and vulcanism. This Power only applies to natural rock and semi-natural materials such as concrete, cement, and asphalt Radically altered material (steel, plastic) is not directly affected by the Power.
</p><p>
	This Power has two ranges, both based on the Power rank. The ability to detect forces and materials within the earth has a range shown on Column C of the Range Table on the inside cover. The ability to actually control those forces is more limited and is determined on Column B.
</p><p>
	The Detection aspect of this Power enables the XcharnameX to sense a variety of earth-related things. These include ground temperature (green FEAT), general mineral composition (green), specific minerals (red), locate caves (green), locate beings moving within the earth (yellow), identify faultlines and stress points (yellow), and communicate with beings made of rock (red).
</p><p>
	The active aspect of this Power enables the XcharnameX to accelerate, slow, or alter the direction of natural geological forces. XcharnameX can affect plate movement; this can create Power rank tremors or reduce the intensity of existing tremors by the Power rank number. XcharnameX can accelerate erosion by decreasing the Material Strength of e XcharnameX posed rock. The flow of magma within the earth can be redirected to anywhere the XcharnameX wants an instant baby volcano to erupt. By magnifying existing faults and decreasing the rock' Material Strength, the XcharnameX can create openings in the earth. These can be instant pits, valleys, caves, or tunnels.
</p><p>
	The effects of the Power are permanent alterations to the landscape.
</p><p>
	Baby volcanoes don&#34;t last very long, though, if the area didn&#34;t have a previous history of vulcanis,. For example, during her tenure with the New Mutants, Magma has created baby volcanoes in such places as Rio de Janeiro' harbor, the living room of Professor XcharnameX avier' man sion, and an apartment in Manhattan.
</p><p>
	Such freakish volcanoes immediately cool down once the Power is no longer supporting their existence; heat is lost at a rate of -1CS per hour. For example, the volcano in the XcharnameX -Mansion was cool enough to sit on by the time Professor XcharnameX came home a few hours later. It is assumed that the cooling effect e XcharnameX tends all the way down back through the ground to where the magma came from in the first place; otherwise all these baby vol canoes would act as conduits for later, normal vulcanism.
</p><p>
	The amount of matter the Power can effect is awesome. The Power can affect a  maximum amount of rock equivalent to ten tons for each point of the Power rank number. For example, Magma' Monstrous Geoforce can affect 750 tons (1.5 million pounds!) at a range of up to si XcharnameX miles.
</p><p>
	The Power can be e XcharnameX panded into a variety of Power Stunts, such as induced Avalanches and sculpting chambers in the earth. The latter example is also a way for the XcharnameX to make some money on the side by creating &#34;secret underground headquarters&#34;on commission. The giant caves that litter the pages of comic books do not occur in real life, people.
</p><p>
	A curious use of the Power is to communicate with beings who are themselves composed of natural rock.
</p><p>
	The Power provides the XcharnameX with a seismic equivalent of Telepathy. Such beings include Golems, Earth Elementals, and planetary beings such as Ego the Living Planet. Is Mother Earth alive in your campaign? If she is, then this Power will let your XcharnameX talk to her.</p>",


	"matter animation" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter the flow of any raw matter, impart movement to stationary matter, and shape such matter into any desired form.
</p><p>
	The Power can only affect matter that is in a relatively natural state. It cannot affect mechanical objects or material that is now or had once been alive.
</p><p>
	There are three basic forms of this Power, each with dominion over a state of matter.
</p><p>
	<em>air animation</em> &ndash; XcharnameX can directly control the movement of gases and vapors and indirectly control the movement of material suspended in the air, such as smoke, dust, steam, and so on. XcharnameX can create winds of speeds equal to Power rank speed (see the Airspeed table on the inside cover). XcharnameX can control the actions or air, wind, clouds, and potentially even the weather. XcharnameX can use air either defensively or offensively by forming shields or gales of Power rank strength. <em>Note:</em> Air attacks cannot penetrate Force Fields or an aerial shield of higher Intensity. The Power can be developed into Power Stunts such as Gliding, Whirlwind Flight, and limited Weather Control. The forms of Weather Control available to the XcharnameX all depend on stirring up the air. These include bringing in storms, fog, tornadoes, and suddenly bringing two air masses of differing temperature together to form either fog or lightning.
</p><p>
	<em>liquid animation:</em> XcharnameX can directly control the movement of liquids and indirectly control material suspended in liquid (mud, cake batter). He can create currents and waves that can travel at Power rank speed (see the Water Travel table on the inside cover) and do Power rank damage to anything in their path. Liquid can animated to resist gravity and act as if it were temporarily a solid of rank level Material Strength. Liquids can be used as a shield that reduces the Intensity of Energy Attacks by the Power rank number. It can be further refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as forming propulsion systems or being shaped into air bubbles with &#34;solid&#34;floors.
</p><p>
	<em>Solid Animation:</em> XcharnameX can alter the condition of solid matter, so long as it is not biological or mechanical in nature. He can give the solid movement, reshape to any form, and even give it the semblance of life. Solids can travel at Power rank speed (see the Land Travel table inside the cover) either across the ground or through the air. The XcharnameX can Mold the solid into any single mass. Solids retain their Material Strength but can be Animated to do Power rank damage to other targets. The XcharnameX can create Golems or simulated Elementals that obey his every whim; such creations are only sophisticated puppets that possess no more life than does a marionette. (Of course, there is the example of Pinocchio&acirc;&euro;&brvbar;) Animated solids possess a Lifting Strength equal to the Power rank. The Power can be refined into a variety of Power Stunts, such as turning an opponent' weapon against him, creating self-tying knots, and creating flying platforms that can carry the XcharnameX across the ground or through the air. The range at which the XcharnameX can Animate Matter is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on Column B of the Range Table. The  maximum amount that can be Animated is a mass weighing the equivalent of 1000 pounds times the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can move one ton; in liquid terms this is the weight of a water bed. Matter remains Animated as long as the XcharnameX concentrates on using this Power. Judges are free to develop their own criteria to determine how well and how long a XcharnameX can do this in a given situation. Any material can be Animated, as long as it is within the restrictions on the chosen form of that Power. Any reshaping done to the target is permanent; of course, this only applies to solids. The possibilities for both construction and vandalism are immense.
</p><p>
	At the time the XcharnameX is created, the player has the option of raising the Power rank +1CS by further specializing the Power' range of effect to a specific compound or type of matter. examples of specializations include Powers that specifically Animate steam, water, oil, ice, clay, and so on.</p>",


	"machine animation" => "<p>XcharnameX can control the movement of anything mechanical. It is as if the XcharnameX were a combination remote-control panel and power source. The machines can only perform those functions for which they were designed. While under the influence of the Power, the affected machines can function even in the absence of a normal power supply, such as would be provided by an electric cord, wound spring, or miniature nuclear generator. The only new function the XcharnameX can give a machine is limited ground movement. Affected Machines can travel at -2CS Power rank speed by sliding or rocking along the ground; see the Surface Movement table inside the cover. If the machine already incorporates a means of propulsion (wheels, tracks, table legs), it can travel at Power rank speed; see ditto.
</p><p>
	The Power can affect any single machine within range of the Power; Column B of the Range Table gives the appropriate limits. If the XcharnameX attempts to control several machines simultaneously, the Range decreases -1CS for each additional Machine the XcharnameX is controlling. For example, a XcharnameX with Good Machine Animation can control a single machine 10 areas away, two machines 5 areas away, three machines within XcharnameX area, or four machines if XcharnameX is touching all of them at once (an interesting Agility FEAT, I suppose).
</p><p>
	The Power is primarily intended to control normally non-sentient devices, which are considered to have a Psyche of zero. If the XcharnameX tries to gain control of a Robot or the mechanical part of a Cyborg, greater effort is needed. It becomes a contest of wills, as the XcharnameX' Power tries to overcome the target' Psyche. The Psyche in question is either that of the Robotic brain or the living mind of a Cyborg; if the Cyborg incorporates both living and mechanical minds, only the Psyche of the mechanical mind is used to determine the difficulty of the FEAT. The latter determines what Intensity FEAT is required.
</p><p>
	example - A Poor rank of Machine Animation could seize control of a Dreadnought' Feeble Psyche with a green FEAT and Ultron-11' Poor Psyche with a yellow FEAT, but couldn&#34;t begin to touch Jocasta' Good Psyche.
</p><p>
	Attempting to wrest control of the Iron Man armor would require a red FEAT if either Tony Stark or Jim Rhodes were wearing it at the time but would automatically succeed if the armor were, say, hanging in a closet somewhere. To protect against such interference, High Technology types would need to develop circuitry that would give the equivalent of a desired Psyche rank to the machine.</p>",


	"micro-environment" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter XcharnameX immediate surroundings to create a miniature climate around XcharnameX. The Micro-Environment always contains fresh clean air (or water or methane or whatever the XcharnameX breathes) at any temperature and pressure the XcharnameX desires. The Micro-Environment incorporates a Force Field that protects it from any factor that might harm or even annoy the XcharnameX, such as rain, poisonous gases, e XcharnameX treme temperatures, or the pressure that naturally results from having three miles of ocean over your head. In such cases, the Micro- Environment automatically e XcharnameX cludes potentially hazardous gases and liquids and reduces the Intensity of pressure, e XcharnameX treme temperature, and high gravity by the Power rank number. Lesser or equal Intensities are canceled out, while higher ranks only penetrate in diminished form.
</p><p>
	The Power automatically Collects the desired materials into a sphere around the XcharnameX; if no such materials are available, the Power employs an innate form of Matter Creation or Conversion to produce those materials. The Force Field maintains the desired pressure, temperature, and gravity levels while enclosing the desired materials and shielding the XcharnameX from the undesired ones. If the XcharnameX requires a surface to stand on but none is available, the Power provides one by solidifying a section of the Force Field.
</p><p>
	The Power is primarily intended to protect the XcharnameX when XcharnameX is in places other than XcharnameX home environment. It can, be used to protect him from e XcharnameX treme variations in that home environment though, should the XcharnameX so choose.
</p><p>
	Thus the Power can be used to protect the XcharnameX in the middle of a house fire, gas leak at a fertilizer plant, radiation spill at a laboratory, a thunderstorm, or a smog alert in Los Angeles. The Power can be used to Resist the effects of Air or Water Animation, Weather Control, Heat, or Cold Generation; the Intensity of the attack is reduced by the Power rank number.
</p><p>
	The Micro-Environment has a  maximum radius in-feet equal to the Power rank number. Normally it is a sphere centered in the XcharnameX but she can shape it or direct it to another location if she so desires. The  maximum range at which the XcharnameX can direct the MicroEnvironment is determined by the Power rank; appropriate distances are shown on Column B on the Range Table. The  maximum volume of the Micro- Environment is the equivalent of a sphere whose radius equals the Power rank number. Figuring out the  maximum volume of other shapes requires a doing a bit of geometry.
</p><p>
	example - A rank of Good can produce a sphere of 3.14(10-cubed) or 3,140 cubic feet. This can be shaped into a rectangular &#34;tunnel&acirc;&euro; 10 feet high, 10 feet wide, and 31 feet long. I suggest that anyone with this Power figure out as soon as possible how big a sphere/ hemisphere/column/tunnel/cone/etcetera XcharnameX can make with XcharnameX Power rank. If you don&#34;t, the Judge is liable to say that mysterious changes in the. environment prevent your XcharnameX' Power from working.
</p><p>
	The Power only protects the XcharnameX from environmental effects or Powers that employ aspects of the Environment.
</p><p>
	Beside the Powers mentioned earlier, this Power will also provide limited protection against Electrical Control, Electrical Generation, Coldshaping, Gravity Manipulation, Hard Radiation and its Control, Thermal Control, Plague Carrier, Geoforce, Spray, and PXcharnameXmones, but only if the offending Power originates outside the Micro-Environment.
</p><p>
	As hinted at before, the Power can be used to create any environment the XcharnameX desires, provided it is beneficial to whatever nature of being is inside its protection. Of course, what is a marvelous climate for one being could be instantly fatal to another. Consider the MicroEnvironments created by beings that thrive on super-heated steam or swim in liquid helium. Player characters are limited to producing only those MicroEnvironments that will help the beings inside. Villainous and Mind- Controlled NPC XcharnameXes are able to pervert the Power and create to XcharnameX ic MicroEnvironments. In such a case, the Power is treated as an attack and the intended victim is urged to Resist it in any way XcharnameX can.</p>",


	"molding" => "<p>XcharnameX can shape any solid material into any desired shape.
</p><p>
	The shaped material retains its original chemical nature. If the target is living, its internal anatomy is rearranged in such a way that permits life to continue without loss of Health. The new shape can be of any comple XcharnameX ity; even intricate machines can be created if the proper materials are available. The newly-Molded target can be Animated, even if the original material or the current shape is normally incapable of movement. This movement is accomplished by the simple act of continually re-Molding the target (think of it in terms of stop-motion animation).
</p><p>
	Molded targets retain their basic Material Strength. New shapes may alter the load-bearing capacity of the material.
</p><p>
	For example, a arch can bear greater weight than a plane and a honeycomb is about the strongest shape there is. Using the Power destructively is easy; using it constructively is harder and requires the player to have some knowledge of basic Engineering.
</p><p>
	The  maximum range at which the XcharnameX can Mold a target is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate distances are.
</p><p>
	shown on Column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	The amount of material the XcharnameX can Mold is a mass weighing 100 pounds times the Power rank number. When creating the XcharnameX, the player has the option of raising either range or amount affected by lowering the other factor an equal amount. For example, a Remarkable rank can Mold 3,000 pounds of material at a range of 8 areas. Either factor can be altered by as much as 5CS and produce results as varied as Feeble range (contact)/Shift XcharnameX effect (15,000 lb.) to Shift XcharnameX range (80 areas)/Feeble effect (200 lb.). The player has the further option of raising the Power rank +1CS by specializing in Molding a particular type of matter, such as wood, metal, stone, and so on. This option is not available if the XcharnameX also possesses any of the Elemental or Molecular Conversion or Creation Powers.
</p><p>
	The comple XcharnameX ity of the intended design determines what Reason FEAT is needed.
</p><p>
	Simple, single-component designs require a green Reason FEAT. Comple XcharnameX or multiple-component designs require a yellow FEAT. E XcharnameX tremely comple XcharnameX designs (anything from a clock on up) requires a red FEAT and probably a set of blueprints.
</p><p>
	E XcharnameX actly duplicating an existing object also requires a red Reason FEAT. The Power can function for as long as the XcharnameX can concentrate. Any failed rolls while attempting a FEAT mean that while the Power has begun to Mold the target, there is a problem because 'omething doesn&#34;t look quite right. Molding automatically affects any stationary, non-living, unprotected material. Moving targets require the XcharnameX to make an Agility FEAT to hit. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power in the same way they would try to Resist any Energy Attack. As mentioned earlier, living targets can be affected but not directly slain by this Power. A target can be protected from being Molded by the use of such Powers as Force Field vs.
</p><p>
	Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, certain Magics and Power Controls, temporary Conversion to a liquid or gaseous state, or an equal or higher rank of Molding. The simultaneous use of a protective Molding Power to counteract an offensive one by continually re-Molding the target into its original shape would look positively psychedelic as the target of both Molders continually rippled and wavered).
</p><p>
	The Power can be used quite profitably to outfit either XcharnameXes or villains with all the arcane and e XcharnameX otic equipment they need. After all, Quinjets, body armor, and nuclear pogo-sticks aren&#34;t e XcharnameX actly off-the shelf purchases. Clever use of this Power could raise the XcharnameX' Resource level anywhere from +1CS to +4CS; the Judge and player will have to work this out for themselves. (&#34;Okay Jeff, in yesterday' game you remodeled the HQ of Dr. Octopus. Today you try to collect what XcharnameX owes you).
</p><p>
	 Weather Control - XcharnameX has complete control over the weather. XcharnameX can sense those factors in the air that create weather and alter any aspect of them at XcharnameX desire. Any of these factors can produce both physical and psychological effects on humans.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can control temperature by raising or lowering the air a  maximum number of degrees equal to XcharnameX Power rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, an Incredible rank can change a comfortable 70 degrees into a wintry 30 degrees or a sweltering 100 degrees.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can increase or decrease windspeed by a number of miles per hour equal to XcharnameX Power rank number.
</p><p>
	For example, an E XcharnameX cellent rank can stop a 20-mph wind, slow a 50-mph gale to 30mph, or turn still air into a 20-mph wind. Gale winds of 40-mph or higher begin to make travel difficult. Whole gales of 55 to 72 mph begin to do widespread damage. Winds above 72 mph reach hurricane strength. Above 200 mph the wind becomes a tornado.
</p><p>
	Wind direction can be changed up to 60 degrees by a green Power FEAT, up to 120 degrees by a yellow FEAT, and completely reversed 180 degrees by a red FEAT. For example, changing a cool northern wind to an east wind is a change of 90 degrees, a yellow FEAT.
</p><p>
	Humidity can be increased or decreased a  maximum percentage equal to the Power rank number. <em>Note:</em> the  maximum humidity is 100%. Apparently humidity has some effect on human behavior and health. As humidity approaches 80% or higher, people become more sluggish and irritable, especially if the air temperature is also 80 degrees or higher.
</p><p>
	If the air has any moisture at all, the XcharnameX can Collect it into any type of cloud, whether Cirrus, Cumulus, Stratus, a common Fog, or any other type. XcharnameX can form Nimbostratus clouds that continually disgorge moisture in the form of rain, hail, sleet,-or snow, depending on the air temperature and wind direction. Rainfall per hour can reach a  maximum number of inches equal to the Power rank number. If the precipitation falls as snow, the snowfall depth is equal to si XcharnameX inches for each inch of rainfall (since snowflakes pack less densely than rain). The Power can form Cumulonimbus clouds into thunderheads that deliver lightning as well as rain. XcharnameX can control the emission and direction of lightning, producing bolts that do rank damage.
</p><p>
	The area of weather over which the XcharnameX has control is a circle (a vertical cylinder actually) with the Weather Controller at the center. The diameter and height of this cylinder is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	Appropriate distances are shown on Column C of the Range Table. For example, when she possessed her full Amazing Weather Control, Storm could control the weather over a fifty-mile wide area. <em>Note:</em> While the atmosphere is composed of four layers and is a few hundred miles deep, only the bottom layers of the troposphere and stratosphere really affect the surface weather. Beyond twenty miles in height, the Power is reduced to a negligible effect.
</p><p>
	The duration of the effect the Power has over the weather varies. XcharnameX has a limited amount of time each day she can actively Control the weather.
</p><p>
	The  maximum length of time is the number of minutes equal to the XcharnameX' Health. Each minute spent using this Power temporarily costs the XcharnameX one point. <em>Note:</em> this does not decrease the XcharnameX' actual Health; instead it decreases a &#34;dummy account&#34;set up for the purposes of the player' bookkeeping.
</p><p>
	The account is replenished at the start of each new day. Returning to the example of Storm, her Amazing rank enabled her to actively control the weather fifty minutes each day. Furthermore, the effect the Power has over the weather does not instantly vanish when the XcharnameX rests. The changes the XcharnameX made continue for a while before things return to their original state. Lingering effects last an amount of time equal to the time spent actively controlling the Weather.
</p><p>
	The Intensity rank of the lingering Weather slowly decreases; the average Intensity rank is half that of the Power rank. For example, if Storm spent ten minutes operating a thunderstorm, that storm would last an additional ten minutes and produce E XcharnameX cellent rainfall and lightning while it slowly dissipated.
</p><p>
	As mentioned briefly, the XcharnameX can detect any aspect of the Weather that XcharnameX can control. A green FEAT enables the XcharnameX to know the local wind' speed and direction, humidity, temperature, the chance for precipitation, and the ne XcharnameX t day' weather forecast. A yellow FEAT enables the XcharnameX to detect these thing anywhere within her Power' range and thus figure out the weather forecast for the ne XcharnameX t two days. A red FEAT enables the XcharnameX to make three-day weather forecasts and more importantly detect the cause and location of any change in the weather, such as distant disturbances or the use of this Power by others elsewhere. For example, with a yellow FEAT the XcharnameX senses a mass of hot air twenty-three miles away. A red FEAT enables her to detect the cause as a fire raging in New Rochelle.
</p><p>
	A peculiar use of the Power involves gaseous beings such as Air Elementals.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create puppets of air whose actions simulate the behavior of Air Elementals. XcharnameX can directly combat real Air Elementals with the Power doing rank damage to the opponent' Health. Imagine this as a vaporous equivalent of a Slugfest.
</p><p>
	Finally, the Power can serve as a means to communicate with gaseous beings. In this case the Power acts as an equivalent to Telepathy.</p>",


	"temporal control" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to control the how he or others &#34;e XcharnameX perience&#34;the temporal continuum. This allows him to reference the temporal frame in which he or others exist so as to cause them to move faster, or slower or &#34;freezing&#34;them in time-space.</p>",


	"zombie animation" => "<p>This is a macabre Power that is definitely more at home in the horror genre than in the XcharnameXic genre. XcharnameX. um, well, the character with this Power can Animate any previously living body. Normally, the Power is used to Animate relatively intact cadavers, since these are capable of a greater variety of actions. Part of the Power is used to halt the process of decay and to maintain the structural integrity of the remaining body parts. Still, Zombies look awful, even the fresh ones.
</p><p>
	This Power is not Biophysical Control/Revival. The Zombies are not alive. They lack the essential lifeforce that is the core of each living being. The Zombies are at best mindless slaves, at worst grotesque marionettes who shuffle on the end of the Zombie Master' strings.
</p><p>
	The condition of a Zombie can range from freshly deceased to skeletal. The latter type of Zombie is little more than a walking skeleton, though being mostly bone it is cleaner than a still-fleshed Zombie. The Zombie does not have to have all its body parts. In fact, the Power can be used to Animate detached limbs or partial remains. These have their uses too. For example, if a character' Physical Type is either Cyborg or Compound/Undead and XcharnameX possesses this Power, perhaps some of XcharnameX body parts are Animated bones grafted onto XcharnameX still living sections. (I told you this is a grotesque Power.) Zombies possess Physical Abilities that are -3CS Power rank. Mental Abilities are Zero-shift."

$aarPowMatterConversion = [
	"coloration" => "<p>The XcharnameX has total control over the coloration and color transmitting abilities of any target substance, whether solid. liquid, or gaseous. That' all, folks. Okay, this seems like the prime number one Wimp Power of all time. Wrong, oh ye of little faith; read on and I&#34;ll tell you how dangerous this Power can be.
</p><p>
	This Power enables the XcharnameX to alter basic physics and the chemical properties of any target. The Power operates in either of these two modes. In the first mode, the XcharnameX can consciously alter the frequency and intensity of light itself. He can change any frequency to any other frequency, including infrared, the visible spectrum, and ultraviolet. Like a prism, the Power can split apart white light into a rainbow or re-combine back into white. He can lower the intensity of light to create normal darkness, even in the midst of brilliant fight, though these shadows lack the opacity of those created by Shadowcasting. In game terms, consider this a -2CS form of both Shadowcasting and Shadowshaping. Different frequencies of light have different properties. By altering the frequency of light, the XcharnameX can alter these properties. Infrared light causes objects to heat up. By converting normal light to infrared, the XcharnameX can cause a -2CS form of Heat Emission. Conversely, by converting Infrared light, the XcharnameX can prevent radiant heating; treat this as a - 2CS Force Field vs. Heat. Ultraviolet light causes changes in pigmentation; effects can vary from the tanning of normal human skin to the rapid fading of printed material. It is also the key to photosynthesis. If the light is in a coherent form, like a laser beam, the effects of color become more dramatic. Red lasers carry more heat and do greater damage for the Intensity. Blue-green lasers can pass unhindered through water. Again, change the frequency of light and you change its effects.
</p><p>
	The second operating mode for the Power is altering the physical coloration of the target material. The color of a object can have great importance both to the fickle aesthetic tastes of humans and to the impartiality of Moms Nature.
</p><p>
	Coloration determines the type and amount of energy that is either reflected or absorbed by the material in question. White and silvery surfaces reflect all light.
</p><p>
	Dark colors and black absorb all light.
</p><p>
	There is the matter of transparency. A perfectly clear substance lets light pass through. examples include air, glass, and the lens in a human eye. Change the degree of transparency and you stop light from traveling though. A character with this Power can stop anything in its tracks if the target depends on vision to find its way around. Conversely, the Power can make an opaque target transparent. Uses for this vary from humane through mischievous to outright criminal. A humane use is curing those types of blindness that result from the loss of the eye' natural transparency. A mischievous use is turning someone' clothing transparent. A criminal use is turning concealing barriers transparent if the character is seeking information behind that barrier; this can be anything from reading the contents of an envelope or locked file cabinet to studying a lock' mechanism while cracking the combination.
</p><p>
	Color conveys information. Change the color and you alter or even destroy the message. Consider the effect changing color has on things as varied as comic books, paintings, photographic film, traffic lights, feathers, furs, and human skin.
</p><p>
	Take the last one, for example. The reason why people get so freaked out by the Hulk is not his size or berserk rampages but that he is bright green! Give the Hulk a normal tan and he could work in Hollywood. On a more prosaic level, the ability to change the color of printed or written material can be have immense consequences in an Information Age society such as our own. The possibilities include both vandalism and creation.
</p><p>
	When using this Power, the XcharnameX must make a Reason FEAT to determine how fine his degree of control is. A green FEAT permits him to change all of a target to a single color; think of the target getting a paint can dumped on it. A Yellow FEAT enables him to change the target to several colors. The effect is the same as being caught by a bunch of near-sighted graffiti artists, each with a different can of spray paint. A Red FEAT gives the XcharnameX fine control and the ability to alter tiny areas in specific ways; think of a talented artist with a very small brush. When the XcharnameX is covering an area, he only affects the e XcharnameX posed surface of any targets. For example, Colorizing a closed book would not harm the printed pages; Colorizing a cow purple wouldn&#34;t change the color of a steak later on. As for the question of affecting the eyes of a living target, the Judge and players should assume that the Power only affects the layer of tears that protect the eye. In effect, the target is momentarily blinded by colored water that quickly washes away. Eyes are such a small target that the character must make a specific red FEAT to do so. Note: this bending of the rules does not apply to the lenses of artificial eyes; cameras and robots are on their own.
</p><p>
	This Power does not actually change the physical nature of a target.
</p><p>
	Elemental, molecular, and genetic structures remain unchanged e XcharnameX cept where Light is concerned. A steel safe made glass-like is still as strong as ever.
</p><p>
	A pane of glass given a steel-like surface shatters just as before.
</p><p>
	The duration of the Power varies. The normal limit is 1 -100 hours after the Coloration occurs. The XcharnameX can immediately reverse any Coloration if he chooses. Sometimes the XcharnameX wants an act of Coloration to be permanent, such as when he tries to cure an old man' cataracts. In that case, a red Power FEAT does the trick.</p>",


	"combustion" => "<p>The XcharnameX has the ability to transform any target into combustible material. Once this Power has been used, spontaneous combustion occurs within 1 -10 turns after. Only the surface layer of matter is converted by this Power. As such, the flames only last 10-20 turns since the combustible material is quickly burned away. The total amount of damage done by this is equal to Power rank Intensity. example: Rusty Collins, a student of XcharnameX Factor, has Monstrous Combustion but has not yet achieved full control over it.
</p><p>
	At present, when he is e XcharnameX cited, he can inflict up to Incredible Intensity damage on a target. When his Power first appeared, his accidental target was a woman who subsequently suffered severe burns.
</p><p>
	The range for the Power is determined on Column A of the Range Table on the inside cover. The  maximum amount of target area the XcharnameX can initially affect is the number of square feet equal to his Power rank times ten. For example, when he is fully trained in the use of his Power, Rusty Collins will be able to ignite an area of 750 square feet at a distance of 40 areas (1 mile) away. The Power only affects the surface of a target that is in sight of the XcharnameX. Using the Power against a gasoline tank would only burn the outside of the tank and any gasoline that had already leaked through bad joints in the tank walls. If the damage were sufficient to rupture the tank or heat the gasoline inside to the combustion point, then the stored liquid could join the blaze. The Power' effects begin to multiply when the power is used against targets that are already flammable or in the immediate vicinity of flammable materials.
</p><p>
	Most of Mankind' manufactured items and buildings contain some percentage of flammable material. Even materials not known for their combustible qualities, like plaster, will burn if enough heat is applied. By taking this into consideration, the clever XcharnameX can simply use his Power as the spark to start an apparently normal fire. Combustion normally occurs only in the presence of free o XcharnameX ygen. If there' no o XcharnameX ygen in the air or if there is no air, period, Combustion cannot take place.
</p><p>
	Using this Power on a target under such a circumstance would have no immediate effect on the target. While the Power would still convert some of the target into, flammable, volatile compounds, these would simply and harmlessly evaporate; used under water, the Power would make bubbles suddenly appear on the target. At Unearthly rank or higher, the XcharnameX gains the ability to transform some of the target into free o XcharnameX ygen as well as fuel, thus permitting the Power the Power to function in a vacuum or hostile environment. If the target is affected by the Power but the flames are somehow prevented from occurring, the target will only remain potentially flammable for 21 to 30 turns after the Power has had its initial effect. At any point during that time, the target can still burst into flame; after that has elapsed, the target is safe. Means that can prevent Combustion from occurring include Elemental and Molecular Conversion, Fire Control, Thermal Control, Cold Generation, Force Field vs. Energy, and Resistance to Energy. Any of these Powers gives its possessor Power rank Resistance to Combustion' effects. example: Rusty Collins is battling a Sentinel. He uses his Monstrous Power to set fire to the Sentinel' faceplate. The Sentinel reacts by spraying e XcharnameX tinguishing foam on itself. The foam has Unearthly fire retardant qualities and prevents the Combustion-affected area from igniting. Unfortunately for the Sentinel, it only lasts 25 turns after initial application. As the Sentinel grabs Rusty, his faceplate belatedly but still spectacularly bursts into flame.
</p><p>
	Rank</p>",


	"disintegration" => "<p>This is the ever popular but never e XcharnameX plained &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Disintegrator Ray. The XcharnameX has the ability to convert any matter into pure energy, usually Light although the player can specify another resultant energy when he first creates the character. The energy dissipates harmlessly and does not affect anyone in the vicinity.
</p><p>
	This Power can affect any target within range and line-of-sight. The range is determined by Power rank; resulting distances are shown on Column A of the Range Table. The  maximum amount of matter that can be disintegrated in a single turn is the number of cubic feet equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Typical Disintegrator can destroy si XcharnameX cubic feet of matter at a range of two areas or 264 feet. When creating the character, the player can alter the Power range or effect if he so chooses. Either the range or the amount affected can be increased any number of Column Shifts by decreasing the other factor an equal amount.
</p><p>
	example: Ken and Sue are both creating Disintegrators. Ken rolls 97 for his Power rank, an awesome Amazing rank for both range and effect. Sue isn&#34;t so lucky and rolls 77, a Good rank for her Cyborg Character. Sue wants deadlier force and chooses to after her range and effect. She decreases her range to Feeble or Contact-only, a loss of -3CS that she can apply to her effect. This increases +3CS to an Incredible effect. Unwilling targets of this Power are allowed to resist it in any way they can.
</p><p>
	Furthermore, the Disintegrator must make an Agility FEAT to aim this Power on a target.
</p><p>
	I mentioned the  maximum area the Disintegrator can effect, but what of the minimum area? The Power comes in handy for doing all sorts of fine-detailed work like sculpting, surgery, or removing unwanted locks. The XcharnameX can Disintegrate as small an area as he can clearly see. With normal, unaided vision, the minimum limit is about 1/128th of an inch. Smaller than that and the XcharnameX needs some kind of magnifying device or Power. Note: this limit is proportional to a normally-sized human of about si XcharnameX feet in height. Enlarged or miniaturized characters have a proportional limit. For example, a 36-foot-tall giant would have a minimum limit of 1/21 of an inch, while a one-foot-tall person would have a minimum limit of 1/768th of an inch or about the size of a cell.
</p><p>
	As stated earlier, the target must be within line of sight since the Power affects the first thing it encounters, e XcharnameX cluding air molecules. Actually, some air is accidentally Disintegrated whenever this Power is used-that' why the Power appears as a glowing beam emitted by the XcharnameX-but not enough to divert the Power from its intended target.
</p><p>
	If an unseen or unanticipated barrier is present between the Disintegrator and the target, that barrier takes the full brunt of the Power that turn. Ken' XcharnameX, Starburst, sights a Dreadnought and immediately tries to Disintegrate it. Unfortunately, Starburst failed to notice the plate glass window the Dreadnought was behind. The window vanishes in a flash of pretty lights as the Dreadnought ducks around the corner. This Power is frequently given, to weapons systems such as the ever popular Disintegrator Pistols that fill pulp SciFi. In terms of normal contemporary Earth technology, a Disintegrator raygun requires Incredible Reason and Physics Talent to design and an Amazing cost in Resource points to build. The Judge is free to decide the range and effect of such a weapon.</p>",


	"elemental conversion" => "<p>The XcharnameX can convert any matter into a specific element. The matter to be converted can be any one element or a combination of elements. The resulting element can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements. Natural elements are those numbered 1 (Hydrogen) to 92 (Uranium) on the Periodic Table; these require a green FEAT to create. Artificial elements are those numbering higher than 92 and do not naturally occur on Earth outside of man' e XcharnameX periments; such elements include Neptunium, Plutonium, and the like. A yellow FEAT is required to create these. Mythical elements include Vibranium and any other imaginary element the Judge decides to add to this category; a red FEAT is required to create these. Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; Judges are therefore instructed to decide which category Adamantium fits into in the Judge' campaign.
</p><p>
	The XcharnameX can alter a finite amount of matter per turn. The  maximum amount per turn is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter weighs the same in its original and transformed states. If the XcharnameX converts matter into denser elements, the volume decreases. Converting matter to lighter elements increases the volume.
</p><p>
	For example, one cubic foot of lead weighs the same as 17.5 cubic feet of carbon. Just exploiting this little fact of life can lead the XcharnameX to develop a variety of Power Stunts. For example, the XcharnameX might cause a sudden vacuum in a room by converting all air to a dense solid, like bismuth.
</p><p>
	Normally, when matter is converted by this Power, it retains its new nature permanently or at least until a reverse transformation is forced on it at a later date.
</p><p>
	At the time the XcharnameX is created, the player has an option of increasing his Power rank by making the Power' effect temporary. The XcharnameX can gain +1CS by reducing the duration of his transformations to the number of turns equal to his Reason rank number. For example, a XcharnameX with Good Reason and Poor Elemental Conversion can convert four pounds of material that reverts to its original state in ten hours. The normal form of this Power is fatal if used on a living target. Tissue transformed by the Power suffers instantaneous death. If the XcharnameX chooses the option of temporary effect, the Power has a different effect on living tissue. The affected area enters Suspended Animation until it reverts to its original state. This can also be developed into a variety of Power Stunts. Of course, if only part of the living target is transformed, the rest of the body still suffers the shock of having part of itself transformed into nonliving elements. The minimum amount of matter that can be transformed is limited only by the XcharnameX' sight. If the XcharnameX can see it, he can transform it. The practical limit for unaided human vision is 1/128th of an inch.
</p><p>
	Lest you think your XcharnameX is going to retire to Brazil and spend the rest of his days turning weeds to gold, let me warn you about the drawbacks. Each pound of matter the XcharnameX converts temporarily costs him a point of Health. This is automatically regained, after 24 hours. On the business side, there is the question of selling the raw elements.
</p><p>
	Gold, platinum, and other rare, valuable elements are kept strictly accounted for by a variety of governmental and business organizations. If your XcharnameX makes a habit of coming up with large amounts of bullion, someone is going to begin to notice. That someone could be anyone from a relatively benign IRS agent come to audit your XcharnameX' accounts to a sinister agent of the Gold Cartel come to shut down the new competitor (i.e., kill your XcharnameX). About the only choice your XcharnameX has is selling small amounts to local precious metals dealers. Going this route can raise your XcharnameX' Resource rank +3CS; any more than that and somebody will notice and take action.
</p><p>
	The range at which the Power can operate is determined by the Power rank.
</p><p>
	Distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. When creating the XcharnameX, the player can choose the option of increasing either the amount affected or the range by decreasing the other factor an equal amount.
</p><p>
	For example, a Typical rank can convert si XcharnameX pounds of matter at a distance of two areas. Either factor can be modified a  maximum of 2CS. One way produces a XcharnameX who has Feeble effect (two pounds) but E XcharnameX cellent range (6 areas). Going the opposite route produces a XcharnameX with E XcharnameX cellent effect (20 pounds) but Feeble range (contact only).
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected.
</p><p>
	Moving targets require an Agility FEAT by the XcharnameX to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to Resist this Power just as they could any other attack. Protections against this Power include Force Field vs. Energy Attack, Resistance to Energy Attack, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Any of these completely protect against a lesser ranked Elemental Conversion and have a limited affect against equal or greater ranks. The Judge is free to decide the results of partial protection against this Power.</p>",


	"ionization" => "<p>The XcharnameX has the ability to change the state of energy in a target. This can have a variety of effects on the target. A target can be electrified by this Power; the target' atoms begin to change into electrically -charged particles. The initial effect this has is to charge the target with static electricity.
</p><p>
	Ne XcharnameX t the target actually emits Electricity at -1CS Intensity. At this point the target will itself suffer an equal amount of damage, provided it is electrically grounded in some way. Finally, the charged atoms begin to fly off in an ionized cloud. Nonliving targets can be destroyed in this manner as the molecular bonds break down. Used this way, the Power does damage equal to -2CS Disintegration.
</p><p>
	Okay, what about beneficial uses for this Power? Well, electricity isn&#34;t the only energy the XcharnameX can charge a target with when he uses this Power. The XcharnameX can e XcharnameX cite the atoms sufficiently to create warmth; this is treated as a -2CS form of Heat. More interestingly, the XcharnameX can charge atoms in such a way that he can make them temporarily ethereal. A target thus affected can Phase through solid matter as easily as someone already in possession of that Power. This comes in handy when the XcharnameX is trying to protect a target from any of the Matter Conversion Powers. He can use this Power to Phase something threatened by the other Power or made threatening because of it.
</p><p>
	The range at which Ionization can occur and its duration are determined by the Power rank. Range is shown on Column A on the Range Table. Duration is a  maximum number of rounds equal to the Power rank number. For example, a Feeble rank can charge a target within reach for two turns. The amount of material affected is generally limited to a man-sized continuous mass. If the target is a specific area of a much larger mass, the Ionization will directly affect only the mansized area, although the rest of the mass can e XcharnameX perience secondary effects based on whatever the XcharnameX is trying to do.
</p><p>
	For example, The Shocker has to Ionize a safe in which some people are trapped. He plans to try to Disintegrate a section of the safe large enough to permit fresh air to enter. There is a danger of electrocution to those trapped within, so Shocker tells them to stand on something that can insulate them from the metal walls and floor. They hurriedly cover themselves with stacks of $100 bills. Outside, Shocker summons his Power. The safe is a 15 -foot cube with walls two feet thick. Selecting a section of the safe' wall with no essential mechanisms inside, he begins. He has a Incredible rank. In the first turn, static electricity crackles in the air; inside the safe, loose bills stand on end. In the second turn, electricity of Remarkable Intensity begins to be generated by the affected area. The safe' lock shorts out as the electricity flows throughout the metal sections of the safe; inside the safe the air begins to smell of ozone. In the third turn, Disintegration of E XcharnameX cellent Intensity begins to occur. Shocker is bathed in a cloud that resembles a fluorescent lamp without the tube. The safe walls are constructed of reinforced concrete and steel, giving it Remarkable material strength. For Shocker to e XcharnameX ecute any meaningful Disintegration, he needs to make a red FEAT based on the diminished Disintegration rank, rather than his normal Ionization rank.
</p><p>
	Shocker' player needs to roll a 95 or higher to burn through the safe. It takes him 11 turns or over a minute to finally accomplish the deed. Hours later it occurred to The Shocker that he could simply have used his Power to make part of the safe temporarily out-of-Phase with the rest of the world. Had he done that, those trapped inside could simply have walked through the temporarily ethereal wall.</p>",


	"molecular conversion" => "<p>The XcharnameX can transform any material into a desired compound. This Power is an enhanced version of Elemental Conversion. Whereas that Power could only create a single specified element, this Power can create a number of elements simultaneously and arrange them in a desired molecular configuration. The matter to be converted can be composed of any element, compound, or combination thereof. The elements that result can be any of the hundred-odd natural, artificial, and mythical elements.
</p><p>
	The compounds they form can likewise be real or mythical. An example of a fictional compound is the alloy Adamantium, a steel alloy that only exists in the Marvel Universe. Mythical compounds or compounds that incorporate a mythical element (like Vibranium) require a red FEAT to create.
</p><p>
	Note: it has never been established whether Vibranium is an element or a compound; while I choose to refer to Vibranium as an element, Judges are free to decide for themselves whether it is an element or a compound in their campaign. Most other compounds require either a green or yellow FEAT to create. The more comple XcharnameX a compound' formula is, the harder it is to create. As a rule of thumb, a compound whose molecules incorporate from two to twenty atoms can be created by a green FEAT.
</p><p>
	A compound with molecules of from twenty-one to one hundred atoms, or alloys of various compounds, requires a yellow FEAT; examples include hydrocarbons. More comple XcharnameX molecules or alloys require a red FEAT; examples include polymers, proteins, and other compounds essential to life. Obviously, playing this Power requires knowledge of basic chemistry. At the least the player must have a crib sheet filled with various useful compounds and their formulas.
</p><p>
	The XcharnameX can after a finite amount of matter each turn. The mass limit is the number of pounds equal to the Power rank number. The amount of matter converted weighs the same either before or after Conversion. The heavier the resulting compound, the smaller its volume. Conversely, the lighter the compound, the more volume it has. This simple fact can be exploited as a variety of Power Stunts. For example, a fistsized rock can be transformed into a roomful of the mi XcharnameX ture of gases we humans consume as air.
</p><p>
	The  maximum range at which the Power can affect a target is determined by the Power rank; distances are shown on column A of the Range Table. At the time the XcharnameX is created, the player has the option of increasing either the Power' range or amount affected by decreasing the remaining factor an equal amount. For example, an Amazing rank can Convert 50 pounds at a range of 20 areas. Either factor can be modified by up to 7CS. This can produce such e XcharnameX treme combinations as Feeble range (Contact only) and CL3000 effect (3000 pounds per turn) or CL3000 range (10,000 miles) and Feeble effect (two pounds).
</p><p>
	The player also has the option of increasing the Power +1CS by making its effect temporary. Normally, Conversions are permanent or at least remain until a reverse Conversion occurs. If the player chooses the temporary option, the Conversion only lasts a  maximum number of turns equal to the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. While permanent Conversions may be fatal to living targets (it depends on what was Converted and what the result was), the temporary form has the side-effect of placing the target area into a form of Suspended Animation until the Conversion wears off. Of course, the Conversion can have severe, even fatal, effects on the rest of the living target if the entire body is not Converted.
</p><p>
	The target must be in line of sight of the XcharnameX for the Conversion to occur. The Power can function even if a normal, transparent barrier such as glass separates the XcharnameX and the target.
</p><p>
	The minimum amount of material that can be affected by the Power is limited only by the XcharnameX' eyesight. In practical terms, the smallest size a Normal Human can see is 1/128th of an inch. Below that requires the use of something to enhance the XcharnameX' vision.
</p><p>
	Stationary, non-living, unprotected targets are automatically affected by this Power. Moving targets require an Agility FEAT in order for the XcharnameX to hit the target. Living targets are allowed to resist Molecular Conversion just as they would any Energy Attack. Targets can be protected from being effected by this Power through the use of other Powers including Force Field vs. Energy, Resistance to Energy, True Invulnerability, various Magics, and various Power Controls. Such Powers will completely protect against a lesser or equal rank Molecular Conversion and offer partial protection against higher ranks. The Judge is free to decide the results of partial protection."

$aarPowMatterControl = [
	"artifact creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create a desired object from virtually nothing. The artifact can be of any substance, and is limited to being composed of a single piece. Although the Power can create facsimiles of more comple XcharnameX construction, close e XcharnameX amination reveals that all the smaller pieces are fused together. However, the XcharnameX can create comple XcharnameX items by forming them one piece at a time.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create in one turn a number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. The durability of the artifact is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the artifact a lifespan of the number of turns equal to the XcharnameX' Reason rank number times 100. A yellow FEAT raises it to 10,000 times the Reason rank number. A red FEAT makes the artifact permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the XcharnameX one Health point. XcharnameX can regain all XcharnameX lost Health points after 24 hours. Thus, the XcharnameX can only create a number of ounces in a single day equal to XcharnameX Health point total.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must have detailed knowledge of the design of whatever XcharnameX wants to create. XcharnameX can only store a finite number of designs in XcharnameX mind at any one time.
</p><p>
	The limit for this Power is equal to XcharnameX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of which items the XcharnameX knows how to create. The list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XcharnameX a new design. If no memory slots are available, the new design replaces an old one. (&#34;That' okay; how many more Dr. Doom masks was I going to need, anyway?) Editor' <em>Note:</em> Matter Creation Powers that create specific items (as opposed to raw matter) bring with them a specified number of memory slots, usually equal to the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. If a XcharnameX should have two of these specific Matter Creation Powers, XcharnameX would then have twice the number of memory slots (equal to XcharnameX Reason rank number times two once for each Power).
</p><p>
	Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of objects that already exist.
</p><p>
	These can be directly studied by the XcharnameX as XcharnameX memorizes their designs. This takes at least ten minutes before attempting the FEAT. Failure requires another ten minutes of study, and another attempt. As you can guess, their XcharnameX might never be able to master certain designs.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can also create new designs based solely on XcharnameX own imagination.
</p><p>
	Since this requires really intense concentration, a red Reason FEAT is needed to store this design.
</p><p>
	The artifact has the same properties as a normally manufactured item of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary designs, the player and the Judge should agree on reasonable statistics for the item in question.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can materialize the artifact at any site within one area. The artifact is initially stationary; you can&#039;t launch an artifact as you can a missile or a spray.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can take advantage of gravity, though, by materializing the artifact uphill or over a target.
</p><p>
	Now that you&#039;ve read all the rules so far, I&#039;ll give you the one exceptionto the weight limit. When creating the character, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of one specific item, like a suit of armor or a costume. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs.
</p><p>
	This Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each -element and compound takes up a memory slot, just like the daggers and shields that are already cluttering the XcharnameX' mind. Such raw matter can be formed in any shape, though. This permits the XcharnameX to change the composition of any of XcharnameX alreadymemorized designs. For example, if XcharnameX already has memorized a knife design and the nature of silver, XcharnameX can make either a steel knife (like the one XcharnameX memorized) or one made of silver.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create facsimiles of living matter, but such facsimiles are not themselves capable of living. XcharnameX can make a dead chicken, but not a live one; however, the one XcharnameX makes will taste just as good. Being able to create corpse versions of yourself could be e XcharnameX tremely handy, especially for villains out to confound the law.
</p><p>
	Optional Powers include a form of Matter Animation that is limited to matter created by the XcharnameX, and Hyper- Intelligence.</p>",


	"elemental creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create pure elements from virtually nothing. XcharnameX can create any desired element in any shape or at any location within one area.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create in a single turn a number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. For example, a XcharnameX possessing this Power at Amazing rank could create 50 ounces per turn. The durability of the newly created matter is determined at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the element a lifespan of 100 turns times the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 turns times the Reason rank number. A Red FEAT means it is permanent.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos needs some quick cash and tries to create gold XcharnameX can sell.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX Power is E XcharnameX cellent (20) but XcharnameX Reason is only Typical (6). XcharnameX rolls a 73 (a yellow FEAT) and manages to create 20 ounces of 24K gold that will disintegrate in 60,000 turns (about 4 days). XcharnameX hurries to the local gold bullion dealer. Unfortunately, the dealer was warned about Synthos. XcharnameX will accept the gold on the condition that XcharnameX can wait one week before turning over payment.
</p><p>
	Each ounce the XcharnameX creates temporarily robs him of one Health point. XcharnameX can recover any Health lost in this way after a 24-hour period, including eight hours of sleep. XcharnameX must get XcharnameX full rest to recover XcharnameX Power; this saves the Judge and player from quibbling over fractions regained by naps and so on. (if you like to quibble, though, then go ahead and use partial recovery.) Thus the XcharnameX can only create a number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Health.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos needs that money now! XcharnameX slinks into an alley and tries it again. A yellow FEAT results in 20 more ounces of unstable-gold. Realizing XcharnameX' near XcharnameX limit, XcharnameX makes a final try to create nine more ounces. XcharnameX succeeds with a red FEAT. A very pale Synthos trudges off to find a pawnshop. XcharnameX can use this Power as an attack by trying to materialize new elements on a chosen target. The target can dodge the attack; if successful, the materialization occurs in the target' former location. The target must be in line of sight and not protected by any barriers. For example, Synthos sees an old foe and tries to give him a faceful of coal dust. XcharnameX didn&#34;t notice that XcharnameX foe was behind an e XcharnameX tremely clear pane of glass. Synthos splatters coal dust all over XcharnameX side of the window.
</p><p>
	Various Power stunts include - Dropping freshly-made weights on a target. Setting targets on fire by materializing self-igniting elements like sodium and phosphorus. Rendering a target unconscious by flooding the area with nitrogen that displaces o XcharnameX ygen.
</p><p>
	Short-circuiting electrical devices by forming copper in their interiors.
</p><p>
	Knocking targets off their feet by covering the ground with silicon.
</p><p>
	Breaking open a lock by forming iron inside it (assuming there is a way into the lock)
</p><p>
	Increasing a fire' Intensity by creating fresh o XcharnameX ygen for it to consume.
</p><p>
	Resisting gaseous attacks or preventing suffocation by surrounding XcharnameX in o XcharnameX ygen.</p>",


	"lifeform creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create living matter and even complete bio-organisms from virtually nothing. The new life can be of any nature, although it can only possess Powers that are intrinsic to its physical structure. The size of the new lifeform is limited by its weight. XcharnameX can create in a single turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. Since the lifeform cannot be assembled in several pieces, but rather must be done all at once, this limits how large the creation is.
</p><p>
	It can grow, though, if it has the time.
</p><p>
	The lifespan of this new creation is determined at its genesis. A green FEAT gives it a lifespan of 100 turns times the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 times the number. On a red FEAT, the lifeform is permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created life costs the XcharnameX one Health point. All points lost in this way are automatically regained after 24 hours. In a single day, the XcharnameX can only create lifeforms whose total weight does not e XcharnameX ceed XcharnameX Health.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must have detailed knowledge of any organism XcharnameX wants to create. XcharnameX can only store a limited number of organic designs within XcharnameX memory. The total number of memory slots available for this Power is equal to XcharnameX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the organisms XcharnameX can create.
</p><p>
	The list can be changes at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XcharnameX a new design. If there are no available memory slots, an old design is discarded to make room for the new one.
</p><p>
	Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of existing organisms. XcharnameX must make a detailed study of the original for at least one hour before attempting a FEAT to memorize it. A failure means the XcharnameX must study the organism for another hour before attempting another FEAT. With sufficiently bad luck, the XcharnameX may never be able to memorize certain lifeforms One note - This Power includes a mi XcharnameX ture of Detection Powers that permit the XcharnameX to study a lifeform down to its atomic level without having to do anything harmful to that lifeform (like dissect it).
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can create new lifeforms based solely on XcharnameX imagination and basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology.
</p><p>
	This requires an active imagination, intense concentration, and a red FEAT to memorize a viable design.
</p><p>
	The newly born lifeform has the same characteristics as a normally born lifeform of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary creations, the player and Judge should agree on a reasonable set of statistics for the being in question.
</p><p>
	This Power also includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. This can be used to create raw biological materials or foodstuffs; examples include sugar, blood, protoplasm, and so on.
</p><p>
	Each material takes up a memory slot.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can materialize XcharnameX creation at any site within one area. The new life is initially stationary but can immediately begin to move under its own power. Like the rest of the Matter Creation Powers, this Power is stopped by the first barrier between the XcharnameX and the site of XcharnameX intended target. So, no, people-you can&#34;t have your XcharnameX inject nasty germs directly into XcharnameX opponent.
</p><p>
	As stated before, this Power can create living replicas of actual beings. The minds of such beings are not as comple XcharnameX as the original, and lack most of the original' memories and all Powers that are not strictly Physical in nature. For game purposes, new life has the following statistics - Fighting -1CS Agility -1CS Strength no shift Endurance no shift Reason Poor Intuition Poor Psyche no shift Health no shift Karma zero Resources zero Popularity no shift Only physical Powers are duplicated.
</p><p>
	Talents&#34;are lost as are Contacts, unless the Contact seeks out the duplicate.
</p><p>
	New life can learn, if it lives long enough. It can even raise its abilities and gain simulations of other Powers the original possesses. The Judge should set XcharnameX own standards, based on what type of beastie the XcharnameX has come up with.
</p><p>
	Here comes the exceptionto all that' been written here so far. When creating the XcharnameX, the player can opt to specialize in creating one unique being, like a Pegasus or a She-Hulk of the XcharnameX' very own. (No more trouble getting dates for this guy) In that case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated as yellow FEATs, thus the XcharnameX is required to periodically recreate XcharnameX chosen companion. Such a continually created being retains its memory from creation to creation and can learn and develop just like any normal lifeform. Any damage suffered by this being disappears when it is summoned anew. If slain, the being immediately disintegrates and its statistics (when it is summoned again) drop to their original levels. XcharnameX should also incur a hefty Karma loss if XcharnameX was directly responsible for XcharnameX companion' death.
</p><p>
	If the XcharnameX possesses other Powers, the player can assign them to whatever lifeforms the XcharnameX can summon. This is an interesting possibility for creating unique characters, especially if Specialization is chosen.</p>",


	"mechanical creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can create comple XcharnameX mechanical devices from virtually nothing. The newly created machine originally forms in one mass, then separates into its components.
</p><p>
	The size of the machine is limited to its weight. XcharnameX can only create in one turn a  maximum number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. Heavier machines have to be assembled in several turns. The durability of the machine is determined at the time of its creation. A green FEAT gives the machine a lifespan of 100 turns times the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT increases that to 10,000 times the rank number. A red FEAT means the machine is permane nt.
</p><p>
	Each ounce of created matter temporarily costs the XcharnameX one point of Health. All points lost in this way are regained after 24 hours. Thus the XcharnameX can only create in a single day a number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Health.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must have detailed knowledge of anything XcharnameX wants to create. XcharnameX can only store a limited number of de-&#34;signs in XcharnameX memory. The total number of memory slots available for this Power is equal to XcharnameX Reason rank number. The player must keep a record of the designs the XcharnameX can create. The list can be changed at any time. A green Reason FEAT gains the XcharnameX a new design; if no memory slots are available, an old design is tossed away to make room for the new one. Normally the Power is used to create facsimiles of existing machines.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must make a detailed study of the machine for at least 10 minutes for each attempted FEAT. Failure to make a FEAT means another 10 minutes of study is required. Some items may be beyond -, XcharnameX XcharnameX' comprehension. if the player is really bad at rolling the dice. XcharnameX can also create new designs based solely on XcharnameX imagination and knowledge of mechanical engineering.
</p><p>
	As this requires really intense concentration, a red FEAT is required to store such designs.
</p><p>
	The newly-created machine has the same properties as a normally manufactured machine of its type. In the case of altered or imaginary designs, the player and Judge should agree on reasonable statistics for the item in question.
</p><p>
	This Power includes versions of Elemental and Molecular Creation. Each element or compound takes up its own memory slot, just like the padlocks and pistols that already clutter the XcharnameX' mind. Such raw matter can be formed into any shape, though. This permits the XcharnameX to change the composition of any of XcharnameX already-memorized designs. For example, if XcharnameX has already memorized a cassette player' design and the nature of platinum, XcharnameX can create either a normal plastic-cased player or a platinum coated one.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can materialize the machine at any site within one area. The machine is initially stationary but if it is self-powered, it can immediately begin to move on its own. XcharnameX can also drop the machine on a target, but that is a real waste of material, people.
</p><p>
	The Power cannot create actual living beings. If the -XcharnameX is trying to create a facsimile of a living being, the best XcharnameX can do is a robotic replica, complete with simulated flesh. Internal e XcharnameX amination immediately reveals gears and pulleys.
</p><p>
	The Power can create potentially sentient machines, such as a miniature copy of a Sentinel. Such a facsimile lacks the detailed programming of the original and must be programmed before it can function. This also applies to any microchip dependent device, such as a computer.
</p><p>
	Just like Matter Creation, there is an exceptionto the rules stated thus far.
</p><p>
	When creating the character, the player can choose to specialize in creating a single copy of a specific design&#34;like a homemade Iron Man suit or a mini jet. In this case, the weight limit is raised from one ounce per Health point to one pound per Health point. Red FEATs are treated the same as Yellow FEATs. Optional Powers include a form of Mechanical Animation limited to those machines created by the XcharnameX, Hyper Intelligence, and Hyper-Invention. Nemesis Powers include Mechanical Animation, and Mental Domination (es pecially induced Amnesia).</p>",


	"missile creation" => "<p>XcharnameX can spontaneously create and launch projectiles. These are propelled to Power rank range. Missiles that simply slam into a target act as Stunning Missiles and inflict Stunning attacks of Power rank Intensity. If the XcharnameX has other Powers, these are combined with this Power to produce missiles with specific effects.
	<ol>
		<li>
			<em>Nullifier -</em>The Missile Power is combined with Power Control/Negation to produce missiles that inflict no direct damage but may nullify inborn or technological Powers with Power rank Intensity. Sleep Darts-the Power is combined with Induced Sleep to create anesthetic darts.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Magnetic -</em>The Power combines with Magnetism to produce missiles with Power rank Intensity Magnetism. These can do Power rank damage to magnetic recordings or delicate electronics, and can attract any iron in the target site (guns, for example)</li>
		<li>
			<em>Ghostcasters -</em>The Power is combined with Illusion-casting to create missiles that emit a static hologram upon hitting the target site.</li>
	</ol>
</p><p>
	Vanisher' power is combined with Induced Teleportation to create missiles that teleport the target to a predetermined destination.
	Energizer-Missiles are combined with Power Transference to give the target part of the XcharnameX' other Powers.
</p><p>
	Any Power in this book can be combined with this Power to create unique missiles for your character. When creating the character, the player should follow this guideline - If there is a way to combine external Powers with this Power, do it.
</p><p>
	Powers that are completely internal in their effects are e XcharnameX empted from this. This includes most of the Mental and Physical Enhancements and all of the Self Alterations and Detection Powers.
</p><p>
	If the character is High Tech, has rolled such Powers as Hyper-Invention or Weapons Tinkering, or possesses a magical device, then the Missile Powers should be combined into a device possessed by the XcharnameX. This may be an e XcharnameX otic gun, a wand, or any other bit of superXcharnameXic paraphernalia the player can imagine.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX has a finite ammo supply, even if XcharnameX creates the missiles as XcharnameX goes.
</p><p>
	The  maximum number of Missiles the XcharnameX can create per hour is equal to the Power rank number. This prevents the clich found in bad Westerns, whereby a lone cowboy holds off the entire Apache nation with a single si XcharnameX shooter. This limit also applies to Technological versions of this Power, in that the gun/wand/whatever simply overheats from repeated use.
</p><p>
	There are two Nemeses for this Power. If the Power is innate to the XcharnameX, Reflection stops it. If the Power is externalized in a weapon, Induced Teleportation works by removing the weapon from the XcharnameX' possession and giving it to the opponent.</p>",


	"molecular creation" => "<p>This is a more powerful form of Elemental Creation. XcharnameX can form several elements simultaneously and form them into any desired compound. XcharnameX can form this on any target within one area. XcharnameX can create in one turn a number of ounces equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. For example, at Poor rank XcharnameX could form only four ounces in one turn. The durability of the newly created compound is determined by a FEAT at the time of creation. A green FEAT gives the material a span of a number of turns equal to 100 times the XcharnameX' Reason rank number. A yellow FEAT raises the multiplier to 10,000, and on a red FEAT the material is permanent.
</p><p>
	Each ounce the XcharnameX creates temporarily costs him one point of Health. XcharnameX can regain Health points lost in this way after a 24-hour period including eight hours of sleep. Thus, the XcharnameX can create only a number of ounces per day equal to XcharnameX total Health points.
</p><p>
	example - Synthos is visiting a primitive culture and decides to give them a gift of useful bronze. XcharnameX Power is E XcharnameX cellent (20) and XcharnameX Reason is Typical (6), but XcharnameX Health is only 50. On XcharnameX first try, XcharnameX makes only a green FEAT. That batch of 20 ounces disintegrates in 600 turns (1 hour). XcharnameX tries again, making a yellow FEAT this time. That' not much better; the batch of 20 ounces disintegrates in four days. XcharnameX honor on the line, Synthos tries again. XcharnameX succeeds with a red FEAT. However, XcharnameX depleted Health only permitted him to create 10 ounces of bronze. Synthos is unaware of this, having passed out from the strain.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can use this Power as an attack by trying to form the new material on a chosen target. Such targets can try to dodge. If they succeed, the material forms in their previous position. XcharnameX must be in line of sight of the target. XcharnameX cannot form material within a target' interior or through any barrier between XcharnameX and the target. Synthos, for example, could not form plastic e XcharnameX plosive within a Sentinel, unless someone left an inspection hatch open where Synthos could see it.
</p><p>
	In order to fully play this Power, the player needs to know some basic chemistry, especially the physical properties of various compounds. XcharnameX can develop Power stunts such as Negating a foe' Energy Emission Power by forming a barrier of insulating material around the target' Emission point.
</p><p>
	Breaking open a door by materializing strong compounds within the crack between the door and the frame.
</p><p>
	Forming weights in the air above a target' head.
</p><p>
	Healing others by creating medicines; their effects last even after the compounds disintegrate.
</p><p>
	Creating electricity by forming the compounds found in batteries.
</p><p>
	Creating unliving simulations of living beings. These have no cell structure, however, and are only incredibly realistic wa XcharnameX dummies.
</p><p>
	Performing temporary repairs on equipment.
</p><p>
	This Power includes the ability to form single elements as in Elemental Creation. This is an innate (not a Bonus) Power. Optional Powers include Matter Animation in any single form and Mechanical Animation. The Nemesis Powers are Disintegration and Matter Animation (all forms, simultaneously).</p>",


	"spray" => "<p>XcharnameX can spontaneously create a directed cloud of gas, mist, or dust.
</p><p>
	The Spray has a range of up to one area. It has the basic properties of doing Feeble damage by choking off the target' fresh air and reducing visibility by -2CS for anyone within the cloud. The main purpose of Spray is combining it with other Powers, thereby producing unique Spray Powers for the XcharnameX. In all these cases, the range remains the same. Other factors, such as the nature and Intensity of effects, are determined by the Power that has been combined with Spray. Some possibilities include - Hallucinogenic - The Spray is combined with Image Generation to produce vivid visual images in the target' mind; these, of course, have nothing to do with reality. The target' Fighting and Intuition drop -3CS.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Corrosion-proofing -</em> The Spray combines with Catalytic Control to lessen corrosive attacks&#34;Intensity by this Power rank number.</li>
		<li><em>Insulation -</em> The Spray combines with any Energy Control to produce a coating that protects any target from that form of Energy Emission. The insulation reduces the energy attack' Intensity rank by the Energy Control' rank number.</li>
		<li><em>Healing Spray -</em> This uses any of the more pleasant forms of Bio-Physical Control to produce a cloud that heals anyone in the target area who has taken damage up to -1CS.</li>
		<li><em>Napalm -</em> The Spray is combined with Fire Generation and does Power rank damage.</li>
		<li><em>Freeze Cloud -</em> The Spray combines with Cold Emission to do Power rank damage.</li>
		<li><em>Shrink Dust -</em> The Spray combines with Diminution to reduce the size of anything in the target area.</li>
		<li><em>Booster Dust -</em> The Spray combines with Power Control/Magnification to raise the Power ranks of everyone in the target area +1CS.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Any Power can be combined with this Power to create unique Sprays for each character.
</p><p>
	When creating such characters, the player should follow this simple guideline - If you can figure out a way to combine externalized Powers with this one, do it.
</p><p>
	Powers that are completely internalized are e XcharnameX empt from this rule. This includes most of the Mental and Physical Enhancements and all of the Self Alterations and Detections.
</p><p>
	If a character. is High Tech, has rolled such Powers as Hyper-Invention or Weapons Tinkering, or possesses a magical device, then the Spray Power should be incorporated into a device.
</p><p>
	This may be a gas gun, ring, horn, or any other piece of superXcharnameXic paraphernalia the player can imagine.
</p><p>
	example - The player rolls up the following Fire Generation, Elemental Conversion, Spontaneous Combustion, Spray, and Enchantment. She is a Humanoid, an Elf to be precise. She determines she is a magical character.
</p><p>
	The first three Powers readily combine with Spray. The player decides that the XcharnameXine possesses a magical flute which she built herself. Besides playing normal tunes, she knows three special melodies that create clouds which possess each of the first three Powers.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX has a finite amount of Spray.
</p><p>
	The  maximum number of Sprays the XcharnameX can create in a 24-hour period is equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. This limit also applies to Technological or Magical versions of this Power; the gasgun/flute/whatever simply clogs up from repeated use.
</p><p>
	There are two Nemeses for this Power.
</p><p>
	If the Power is innate to the XcharnameX, then Reflection stops it. If the Power is externalized in a device, Induced Teleportation works be removing the device from the XcharnameX' possession and turning it over to the Nemesis."

$aarPowMentalEnhancement = [
	"clairaudience" => "<p>XcharnameX can &#34;hear&#34; distant sounds and voices despite any intervening distance or barriers. The Power is not hindered by factors that affect normal sound transmission, such as distance, time lag, muffling, distortion, or the absence of a transmitting medium.
		<br />
	Because of this, Clairaudience has superior range over Hyper-Hearing. Only Clairaudience enables the XcharnameX to hear across a vacuum, for example.
		<br />
	Unfortunately, Clairaudience can act as a pipeline to direct another' Psionic or Sonic attacks toward the XcharnameX. Because of this side-effect, the XcharnameX is -1CS to resist such attacks. These attacks need not even be aimed at the XcharnameX but might still affect the XcharnameX if the other Power is being used in the area the XcharnameX is spying upon.
		<br />
	example - Captain Tympanic is using XcharnameX Power to eavesdrop on bankrobbers planning a heist. Unfortunately, Charmer appeared and used her Hypnotic Voice Power to capture the gang. Capt.
		<br />
	Tympanic is caught in her spell as well.
		<br />
	The ranges for Clairaudience are shown on column E of the Range Table.
		<br />
	When the Power operates, it overrides the XcharnameX' natural hearing. Distant sounds are sensed at their original volume level. If the volume is too loud the XcharnameX can reduce it with a green FEAT. Faint sounds can be magnified by a yellow FEAT. The Power is normally a voluntary Power that musty be summoned. Sometimes it functions automatically; this can be the result of improper control, tampering by outside forces, or be triggered by sudden, dramatic events occurring to someone with whom the XcharnameX shares an emotional rapport. (&#34;That was Lewis crying for help!&#34;) When using the Power to eavesdrop on another Clairaudient, that person may automatically sense the first Clairaudient' effort. This is determined by the Judge making a secret red FEAT based on the second XcharnameX' Power rank.</p>",


	"clairvoyance" => "<p>XcharnameX can 'ee distant sights without directly seeing it with XcharnameX eyes. XcharnameX receives a visual simulation of what XcharnameX would see if XcharnameX were actually present at the scene. The Power is not hindered by any of the factors that affect normal light transmission, such as distance, blockage, obscurement, and time lag. It can be used to see things that are impossible for a telescope or Telescopic Vision. For example, a Monstrous Clairvoyant could see current conditions inside a sealed room on the surface of Venus.
</p><p>
	The ranges for this Power are shown on Column E of the Range Table. When in use, the Power overrides normal vision. Normally the Power is consciously controlled. Sometimes it functions automatically. This can be the result of improper control, interference, or be triggered by sudden, dramatic events occurring to someone who whom the XcharnameX shares an emotional rapport. (&#34;Oh no, Billy Jo fell off the bridge!&#34;) The Power can work against the XcharnameX if unwanted visions obscure the XcharnameX' sight or distract him at a crucial moment.
</p><p>
	For example, if Dr. Strange had a sudden flash while operating on a patient, a malpractice suit might be in order.
</p><p>
	When the Power is used to spy on another Clairvoyant, there is a possibility of that person detecting the use of the Power. The Judge makes a discreet Red FEAT based on the observed character' Power rank.
</p><p>
	Clairvoyance can function as a pipeline to draw light-based and Psionic attacks toward the XcharnameX. Such attacks may even affect him if they were aimed at something else within the area XcharnameX is spying upon. XcharnameX has -1CS resistance to such attacks.</p>",


	"communication with animals" => "<p>XcharnameX can understand and use the languages employed by animals and other non-sentient lifeforms. The Power can be used to communicate with nonsentient alien creatures but not intelligent aliens. The degree of difference between the XcharnameX and the animal determines what color FEAT is required. Assuming the XcharnameX is human, a green FEAT permits communication with mammals. A yellow FEAT permits communication with birds and reptiles. A red FEAT covers everything else. If the XcharnameX has a different physical type, the player and Judge will have to modify the FEATs accordingly.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX must be in communications range of the animal for the Power to work. This varies from species to species. The basic rule is that the  maximum range is the greatest distance at which the XcharnameX and animal can sense each other.</p>",


	"Communication with cybernetics" => "<p>XcharnameX can directly communicate with comple XcharnameX machines, whether these are computers or machines not normally considered to have artificial intelligence.
</p><p>
	Any machine that possesses any kind of programming can be communicated withcalculators, digital watches, microwave ovens, even music bo XcharnameX es. The higher the rank, the simpler the machine that can be spoken to. A green FEAT can communicate with a machine possessing several microchips; a computer is the most common example. A yellow FEAT communicates with devices possessing a single microchip, such as watches and talking dolls. A red FEAT communicates with machines that lack microchips but are still somehow programmed, like player pianos and hand-cranked adding machines. The nature and quality of the information received reflects the nature of the machine that is spoken to.
</p><p>
	Communication occurs without the XcharnameX needing to resort to programming languages and input devices such as punchcards and keyboards. After all, if the XcharnameX did need them this wouldn&#34;t really be a super power. When using the Power, the XcharnameX transfers part of XcharnameX intelligence and Psyche to the machine, thus allowing it to respond to him. Unfortunately, sharing XcharnameX mind with machines on a regular basis leads the XcharnameX to identify a little too closely with machines.</p>",


	"communication with non-living matter" => "<p>This is a catchall name for anything not covered by the other Communication Powers (M3, M4, M6). It will enable the XcharnameX to communicate with anything that had once been either sentient, cybernetic, or alive, as long as the target lacks those qualities now. XcharnameX transfers part of XcharnameX intelligence and Psyche to the target, thus permitting it to respond to him. The target can converse, provide information, and even have a personality. The Power includes an innate, unconscious use of Speechthrowing. Although the XcharnameX actually provides the voice, it appears that the target actually speaking.
</p><p>
	When the Power is used to speak a corpse, it uses an unconscious, automatic form of Postcognition to create a simulation of the spirit that once inhabited the body. XcharnameX does not speak with the actual spirit. This can lead to an odd situation in which the actual ghost hears XcharnameX own body speak as if XcharnameX were still in it. Unfortunately, the XcharnameX may develop a personality quirk that blurs the distinction between life and death. As XcharnameX can speak with both the living and the dead, XcharnameX might not be able to see what the difference is. This can be taken to grotesque e XcharnameX tremes, especially in a horrific campaign.
</p><p>
	The Power can be used to pry into a person' secrets by interrogating that person' possessions. For example, clothing will blithely recount the wearer' activities and a wall safe will proudly list all the things it is protecting. Note: Projectile weapons only remember when they were fired, not at whom.</p>",


	"communication with plants" => "<p>XcharnameX can speak with plants. Anything that has a vegetable physiology can be affected by this Power, such as grass, trees, and the Man-Thing. When using the Power, the XcharnameX imparts some of XcharnameX intelligence and Psyche to the plant to facilitate communication. The greater the comple XcharnameX ity of the plant, the easier it is to communicate with. A green FEAT communicates with trees and local ecosystems; in the latter, all the plants speak as if a chorus that only the XcharnameX can hear. A yellow FEAT communicates with shrubs, vines, and bushes. A red FEAT communicates with simple plants and fungi; if the XcharnameX has Hyper-hearing, it can be combined with this Power to permit communication with plankton and bacteria.
</p><p>
	Combining the Power with Sensory Link enables the XcharnameX to share the e XcharnameX periences of plants, even those on alien worlds if the latter Power' rank is high enough.
</p><p>
	A problem can develop if the XcharnameX begins to identify too closely with plants.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX might find salads offensive. Worse, XcharnameX may begin to suffer anguish when plants are harmed in XcharnameX presence.</p>",


	"cosmic awareness" => "<p>XcharnameX is in tune with the entire scope of reality. XcharnameX possesses a detached, omniscient viewpoint that allows him to e XcharnameX plore the entire existence of a chosen subject.
</p><p>
	Unfortunately, this causes such a massive overload of superfluous information that the XcharnameX is hard pressed to sort it all out. The FEAT represents the XcharnameX' ability to recover a specific bit of information from all the effluvia. The more e XcharnameX act the required detail, the higher the difficulty. Discovering basic facts or locating any one on the Earth requires a green FEAT. Comple XcharnameX information or finding anyone within a star system requires a yellow FEAT. Secrets, weaknesses, arcane knowledge, and anything else the Judge wants to make difficult to find out requires a red FEAT.
</p><p>
	The Power can be used to automatically track any Class 1000 or higher Power within ten miles of the XcharnameX' position. In combat the Power raises the XcharnameX' own attacks +1CS by detecting the weak points in the opponent.
</p><p>
	The major drawback to this Power is that can lead to insanity, especially catatonic withdrawal, as the XcharnameX' Psyche is continually inundated by a flood of information. The Judge can determine the chance of temporary insanity by secretly making a Reason FEAT for the XcharnameX; a green, yellow, or red FEAT means the XcharnameX has retained all XcharnameX marbles for another day. The Judge should make this check any time the XcharnameX uses the Power more than five times a day or a number equal to 10% of the Power rank number, whichever is higher. Because of this, caution is urged in the use of this Power. If the Power is somehow negated, the XcharnameX may also go into a state of shock or severe depression. Any mental problems the XcharnameX suffers can be cured by normal psychotherapy.</p>",


	"danger sense" => "<p>This is also called Combat Sense and Spider-sense. It is a combination of automatically functioning Psionic Powers (Telepathy, Empathy, and Precognition) that warns the XcharnameX about impending danger. The advance warning time is the number of seconds equal to the Power rank number (rounded up to the nearest turn if need be). For example, Spider-Man' Amazing rank can warn him of danger almost a minute in advance.
</p><p>
	In a combat situation, the Power can be used replace other, lower ranked Abilities. It can replace Intuition for determining surprise, Fighting for blocking, Agility for dodging, and Strength for escaping.
</p><p>
	The minimum level for this Power must be equal to the -XcharnameX' Intuition. If it' initially lower, the player can raise it to this level. The player can also raise its rank +1CS by choosing to make it a voluntary rather than an automatic Power. That is, it only functions if the XcharnameX is making it function. Spiderman' version functions at all times, but your XcharnameX might decide the risk of being caught off-guard is worth the reward of the higher rank.
</p><p>
	The nature of the Power reduces the XcharnameX'.</p>",


	"dreamtravel" => "<p>XcharnameX can actually enter into the short-lived pocket dimensions created by a person' dreams and nightmares. These dreamworlds are outside the boundaries of normal reality and exist solely as a reflection of the dreamer' imagination.
</p><p>
	The Dreamtraveler must be within ten feet of the dreamer in order for the Power to function at full rank. The Power rank decreases -1CS for each additional 10 feet that separates the two.
</p><p>
	The Dreamtraveler has no direct control over the conditions within the dreamworld. XcharnameX can interact with things within that world by performing physical actions much as XcharnameX would in the real world. Fighting, Agility, Strength, and Endurance are all represented by this Power' rank. If the XcharnameX has other Powers, these exist in equivalent forms that possess this Power' rank instead of their own. The Dreamtraveler can suffer real damage as a result of events that affect him within the dreamworld. XcharnameX might even die. The equivalent of the damage appears in the XcharnameX' real body.
</p><p>
	Normally the XcharnameX' real body retains its solidity during Dreamtravel. The player can raise the rank +1CS by making the XcharnameX' body dematerialize whenever the Power is used. In this case, if the XcharnameX is slain or trapped within the dreamworld, the body might never reappear.
</p><p>
	Each dreamworld is unique to the specific dreamer and retains no existence e XcharnameX cept during the act of dreaming. Dreamworlds are not the same as the Dream Dimension, although it is possible they exist within the greater Dream Dimension. It is possible that dreamworlds touch each other and may even overlap in the case of telepathic dreamers. If so, it is possible that the Dreamtraveler can enter one dreamworld and e XcharnameX it one of someone else'.</p>",


	"empathy" => "<p>XcharnameX can detect the surface emotions of others. XcharnameX can detect the target' emotional state and further refine that knowledge to discover the target' physical state, surroundings, and location, insofar as these have an influence on the emotions.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can transmit XcharnameX own emotional state but XcharnameX cannot impose this on others (that requires Emotion Control).
</p><p>
	Empathy is e XcharnameX tremely useful when the XcharnameX has to deal with non-sentient beings or large numbers of people. It can read the target' mood and support already existing emotions. The range can vary within a single Power rank. The distances shown on column B of the Range Table refer to a single target.
</p><p>
	Each additional target reduces the range -1CS. Range never falls below Feeble, even if the XcharnameX is trying to read the emotions of a crowd. The Power functions for as long as the XcharnameX concentrates on using it. XcharnameX can send Empathic, messages by means of a Power FEAT. The message is in the form of a burst of emotion accompanied by a subtle identification of the Empath.
</p><p>
	A green FEAT transmits to a known person and location. A yellow FEAT transmits to a known person in an unknown location. A red FEAT is the Psionic equivalent of a general announcement. (&#34;Did you feel that? Felt like somebody was really scared – Wait a minute. That was Sender. XcharnameX needs us!&#34;).</p>",


	"free spirit" => "<p>XcharnameX' soul is capable of independent existence in the real world. The Free Spirit can leave the XcharnameX' body and travel independently; it is often mistaken for an Astral Body. The Free Spirit can even survive the death of the physical body without being immediately drawn into an afterlife dimension; this requires a red Power FEAT at the time of death (more on this later).
</p><p>
	Free Spirits possess all the Mental Abilities, Talents, and Powers of the whole being. Health remains unchanged although now it is more of a measure of how well the Free Spirit can resist entering the appropriate afterlife.
</p><p>
	If the Free Spirit is still in XcharnameX original body, that body may either retain a share of the overall consciousness when the.
</p><p>
	spirit is away or the body may lapse into a coma at these times. There an equal chance of either, although the player should choose one at the time the XcharnameX is created. If the original body is dead, the Free Spirit can develop bonds to one or more new bodies, dwelling like a tenant in each but tied to none. The Free Spirit cannot Possess the body or in any way hinder the real owner' abilities.
</p><p>
	They do share a telepathic bond that e XcharnameX tends into shared dreams. If the Free Spirit possesses Powers that require a physical form to use, XcharnameX can lend these to whatever body XcharnameX is occupying. When this Power appears during the character generation process, the player must decide whether the body the Free Spirit is occupying is XcharnameX own or a loaner XcharnameX picked up along the way. In the latter case, the player will then have to generate two complete sets of statistics, those of the Free Spirit and the real owner of XcharnameX current body.
</p><p>
	Free Spirits can be created later on.
</p><p>
	Any character who dies in a campaign has a chance to become one, even if XcharnameX did not possess this actual Power to begin with. The transformation is accomplished by making an Unearthly Psyche FEAT and e XcharnameX pending all the XcharnameX' Karma.</p>",


	"hallucinations" => "<p>XcharnameX can create illusions directly within the target' mind. Such illusions are telepathic, not holographic, in nature. As such, they cannot be mechanically detected or recorded e XcharnameX cept by devices that simulate Telepathy or human thought patterns (such as player character Robots).
</p><p>
	Hallucinations can only be seen by the target of this Power.
</p><p>
	The ranges for this Power is shown on column A of the Range Table. The target must be within sight of the XcharnameX, although the XcharnameX can e XcharnameX tend XcharnameX sight and thus XcharnameX Power range by the use of artificial aids. These include telescopes, remote TV cameras, clairvoyance, and Telescopic Vision. The target need not see the XcharnameX in order for the Power to affect him. Normally the Power affects only a single target. Each additional target decreases the range -1CS. Targets are allowed to disbelieve the Hallucination by making an Intuition FEAT but only if they suspect the true nature of what they are seeing.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations last as long as the XcharnameX concentrates on creating them. They inflict no real physical damage but can be used to disguise an actual Power' use.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can use one additional Power simultaneously with this one.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations can be used to inflict psychosomatic damage. If the apparent damage is believable, the target will physically react to it. Hallucinatory &#039;death&#039; results in the target lapsing into unconsciousness for 1-20 turns. Since a target who takes the time to e XcharnameX amine XcharnameX wounds will realize XcharnameX has not been hurt (at least not in the way XcharnameX thinks XcharnameX should be), the XcharnameX is advised not to use Hallucinations that rely on direct attacks.
</p><p>
	Hallucinations have limited effects on non-sentient or e XcharnameX tremely alien beings.
</p><p>
	They have no effect at all on Moms Nature. A Hallucinatory wall might stop a puma but it won&#34;t stop a boulder rolling down on the XcharnameX.</p>",


	"hyper-intelligence" => "<p>Normally a character' Intelligence is determined in the Character Generation Process.
</p><p>
	However, the research for the Ultimate Powers Book showed that e XcharnameX treme levels of Intelligence can be a Power in its own right. examples include The Leader and the late Soviet scientist known only as Gargoyle. The hyper-intelligent character is a genius of awesome potential. XcharnameX can quickly master new subjects, retain that knowledge indefinitely, and easily succeed in any mental endeavor.
</p><p>
	There are two ways the Power can be incorporated into a character. The player should choose one when XcharnameX first creates the character (a coin toss will do).
</p><p>
	The first method is a permanent modification of the XcharnameX' Intelligence.
</p><p>
	The Power rank number is added to the XcharnameX' previously generated Reason or Intuition rank number. The total is the XcharnameX' actual Hyper-intelligence. For example, a character like the Leader started off with Good Reason. The gamma rays added Incredible Hyper- Intelligence for a final total of Amazing Reason rank.
</p><p>
	The second method uses Hyper- Intelligence the same way most other Powers are used-intermittently. Just as Siryn doesn&#34;t scream all the time, so too would a Hyper-intelligent character have normal intelligence most of the time.
</p><p>
	When XcharnameX uses XcharnameX Power, XcharnameX transforms XcharnameX into a mental giant. The way it operates is the character' normal rank for either Reason or Intuition is raised the number of levels equal to the Power rank (Feeble is +1CS, Poor +2CS, and so on).</p>",


	"hyper-invention" => "<p>This is a special form of Hyper-intelligence that is common enough to merit its own classification. It is a permanent enhancement of the XcharnameX' overall intelligence that is channeled into the field of mechanical design and engineering. XcharnameX is an Edison-like genius who take existing materials and technologies and use them to create new devices or applied technologies. XcharnameX can repair previously operational devices, even if the device was of an unknown type.</p>",


	"hypnotic control" => "<p>More of a talent then an actual power, XcharnameX can dominate a target' behavior and actions by implanting commands, not by direct psionic control. The Hypnotic command may pertain to current conditions or lie dormant until triggered by future conditions (post-hypnotic suggestion). Hypnotic controls come in two forms:
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Commands alter current behavior. &#34;You are getting sleepy.&#34;</li>
		<li>
			Suggestions alter future behavior. &#34;You hate orange, rocky skin and must destroy anything with it.&#34;Normal hypnosis cannot make a person/animal perform any action that goes against his sense of ethics. However, the target' innate sense of morality can be lessened, allowing less conflicting commands to win out. Hypnotic Control can be established by any one of a number of means. These include specific gestures, words, songs, or devices. The Intensity and duration of a Hypnotic Control are determined by the Power rank. In the case of post-hypnotic Suggestions, duration does not include the time prior to activation of the suggestion, but only the time the suggestion is actually in force.</li>
	</ul>",


	"incarnation awareness" => "<p>This Power is based on the idea that a spirit enters countless reincarnations throughout eternity but that the memory of each past life is usually lost somewhere in the transition from one life to another. This Power allows the XcharnameX to remember the details of XcharnameX more recent lives and to actually communicate with them. Such communications include the transmission of the complete range of senses and thoughts. There are two limits on communication with other lives. One, the communication can only be initiated by the XcharnameX' current incarnation. XcharnameX cannot be called by past lives nor can XcharnameX call future lives. However, that doesn&#34;t prevent the XcharnameX from receiving messages from XcharnameX future selves. This can be a quick way to start an adventure (more later).
</p><p>
	Two, the XcharnameX can only reach past selves at points when they are actually living. XcharnameX cannot reach selves that are in an afterlife situation. In fact, the XcharnameX can&#34;t really recall ever being in any form of afterlife. The Power rank number is also the number of consecutive past lives the XcharnameX can contact. The earliest incarnation is the lifespan in which the Power first appeared; it has been growing one point at a time ever since. This limit spares the player the responsibility for making up a mega-biography going back to the dawn of time. It spares the Judge by limiting the potential havoc the player can wreak using XcharnameX now dead contacts. Assume a full but average lifespan for all past lives. From the 18th century on, this is 70 years. Prior to that, the average is 50.The time elapsed between incarnations is up to the player, but at least one incarnation per century is recommended. Soon after the player acquires this Power, XcharnameX should work out a basic timeline for and list of XcharnameX past incarnations. Players are urged to make their past lives relatively normal people.Still, if the player is determined to fill up XcharnameX past with glory after glory, the Judge can insist on a simple rule. To wit there is a 1% chance that any specific historical figure was a former incarnation of the present-day XcharnameX.>The Power is used primarily to gain information. XcharnameX can make e XcharnameX tremely long-ranged plans that involve the assistance of past lives in solving current problems.
</p><p>
	<em>example -</em> Self-1988 asks Self-1920 to have a tunnel dug under the site of the present day Latverian Embassy. A trust fund to be set up by Self-1855 will pay for it.
</p><p>
	Sometimes a future incarnation will request that the XcharnameX perform a special act. The reason for the act might never be e XcharnameX plained. In this, way, the XcharnameX and XcharnameX associates might suddenly find themselves thrust into e XcharnameX tremely strange or terribly mundane situations. (&#34;It is crucial that you make sure Jon Clifton gets to school today! Then bury ten pounds of Adamantium at these coordinates in the Gobi Desert.&#34;) Even the best laid plans of mice and men go astray. Any time the XcharnameX asks a past-self to perform an action that has a direct, physical effect on the present, XcharnameX must make a FEAT roll. This represents the chance of long-range plans coming to fruition. Each century between the present- self and the past- self raises the Intensity FEAT +1CS.
</p><p>
	<em>example</em> - The Trust Fund set up in 1855 requires a Poor Intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	The tunnel requires a Feeble Intensity FEAT. The player rolled a 30 and a 56.
</p><p>
	The trust fund failed somewhere along the way but the tunnel got built anyway using alternative funding.
</p><p>
	The Optional Powers include either Time Travel limited to any past lifetime, a combination of Time Travel and Free Spirit that enables the present-self to possess the bodies of other selves, or a specialized form of Time Travel that enables the present self to draw other selves from their times to the present.</p>",


	"illusion-casting" => "<p>XcharnameX can create realistic holographic images that have apparent solidity/seem absolutely real to all five senses. These Illusions can be mechanically detected and recorded by such means as photography or television. That separates this Power from the psionic, image-generating Power called Hallucinations, which produces images directly in the subject' mind and cannot affect mechanical senses. The Illusion can take any size or appearance XcharnameX desires and is limited only by XcharnameX imagination. The Illusion can be a realistic simulation, a fanciful creation direct from XcharnameX' mind, or an abstract display of light. XcharnameX is playing with light itself and can create anything that is visible. Since most people depend on vision to gain information on their surroundings, this Power presents the awesome ability to apparently alter the nature of reality. XcharnameX can cast XcharnameX Illusions anywhere within XcharnameX Power rank range, though he must be able to clearly see the area where the Illusion is forming if he wants to make it at all realistic. The normal limit for unaided vision is roughly 50 yards. Beyond that range XcharnameX can no longer clearly see XcharnameX Illusion' surroundings and thus cannot alter the Illusion to reflect things going on around the Illusion. For example, an Illusionary tree cast 75 yards away might seem to be floating a discreet two inches above the ground. If XcharnameX is unconcerned about maintaining the reality of XcharnameX Illusions, this limit can be ignored. XcharnameX does not even need to be able to see the Illusion as it forms. Such uncontrolled Illusions appear as transparent, free floating apparitions. If the Illusion takes the form of a living being, viewers might see it as a ghost or other phantom form. If XcharnameX possesses a means of e XcharnameX tending the range of XcharnameX senses, he can maintain the realism m of XcharnameX Illusion at up to full range of both this Power and that of whatever means he uses to e XcharnameX tend XcharnameX vision. Ways of increasing the senses&#34;range include mechanical means such as binoculars and remote TV cameras and sense- e XcharnameX tending Powers, most notably Telescopic Vision and Clairvoyance. Illusions last as long as XcharnameX concentrates on maintaining their existence. The Judge is free to determine how long XcharnameX can maintain XcharnameX concentration in a given circumstance. Breaking XcharnameX' concentration abruptly terminates the Illusion, while merely getting distracted causes the Illusion to begin to lose realism (drift, lose detail, become translucent, and so on). The Illusion' effect on a viewer varies. A viewer must make an Intuition FEAT against the Power rank of the Illusion- caster; success means the viewer now recognizes the Illusion' true nature. Players running characters viewing an Illusion are only allowed to make a FEAT if they suspect the Illusion. This can occur if they physically touch the Illusion, if the Illusion is somehow flawed, or if the character is just naturally cynical. (&#34;Congratulations, Les. So far this morning you have attempted to disbelieve the existence of a flying saucer, Galactus, two muggers, and your breakfast.&#34;). Since Illusion-Casting includes the Power of Light Control, Illusions can provide a measure of protection against light- based attacks. An Illusory tent would provide protection against both infrared and ultraviolet light, thus keeping XcharnameX cool and safe from sunburn. Treat this Power as +2Rs Resistance to Light- based attacks. It does not provide protection against any of the other ways Moms Nature has of affecting us. That Illusory tent would be drafty, cold, and flimsy.</p>",


	"iron will" => "<p>XcharnameX has complete conscious control over XcharnameX mind and body. By using XcharnameX Iron Will, the XcharnameX can temporarily halt the damage done by mental or physical attacks; XcharnameX can even postpone XcharnameX own death. Iron Will can be used in place of any lower- ranked Ability to determine Resistance to an attack. Any time the XcharnameX suffers damage from an attack, the Power can temporarily absorb it before it can affect any of the XcharnameX' Ability ranks. The  maximum amount of damage Iron Will can absorb at one time is equal to its rank number. Absorbed damage does not affect the XcharnameX at that time. Damage e XcharnameX ceeding that amount affects XcharnameX in its normal manner. The XcharnameX can maintain XcharnameX Iron Will indefinitely but will eventually have to rela XcharnameX XcharnameX self-control in order to heal and renew XcharnameX Power. Letting down XcharnameX control causes XcharnameX to immediately suffer a loss of Body points equal to one half the amount of damage Iron Will had absorbed. Regardless of the original nature of the attack, it is always translated into lost Body points; this reflects the strain the Power places on the body. Once the translation occurs and the Iron Will has been purged of its burden, it is able to absorb new damage. The cycle of absorption/purging/ absorption can continue until the XcharnameX' Health drops to zero or below.
</p><p>
	Note: Iron Will can still absorb damage, even if the conversion of that damage into Health points will result in thier immediate death. In such a case, XcharnameX had best make sure XcharnameX is already in an e XcharnameX cellent Trauma Center when XcharnameX rela XcharnameX es XcharnameX Power.</p>",


	"linguistic" => "<p>This is a specialized form of Hyper- intelligence. XcharnameX has the ability to rapidly learn any language if sufficient material is available for him to work with. Once the language is mastered, the XcharnameX is fluent in that language, provided XcharnameX is physically capable of communicating in it.
</p><p>
	The number of languages a XcharnameX is currently fluent in is limited to the Power rank number. For example, Doug Ramsey' Incredible rank enables him to retain fluency in up to forty languages at a time. When a XcharnameX e XcharnameX ceeds that limit, XcharnameX begins to forget a previously mastered language. This will usually be some obscure tongue the XcharnameX has had little use for, like Basic Otter or Mephitish.
</p><p>
	The speed with which a XcharnameX can learn a new language is determined by its strangeness and what source materials are available. Current human languages require a Poor FEAT. Archaic human languages are a Good FEAT. Alien but Humanoid languages are Remarkable FEAT. Animal languages are an Incredible FEAT (note not all animals have an actual language). Alien, nonhumanoid languages are an Amazing FEAT. The color of the FEAT is determined by the source of the language. A green FEAT is needed if the XcharnameX has access to actual instructional materials or a cooperative native speaker of that language who also speaks a language the XcharnameX knows. A yellow FEAT is needed if the XcharnameX has a native speaker who cannot speak any tongue the XcharnameX knows or if the XcharnameX only has non-instructional samples of that language. A red FEAT is needed if the XcharnameX has only fragments of the new language. For example, learning Shi&#34;ar from watching a broadcast of a speech by Majestri XcharnameX Lilandra is a yellow Remarkable Intensity FEAT. Learning spoken Primate by actually using sign language to talk with a chimpanzee requires a green incredible intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX can try a FEAT roll every hour. Failure means XcharnameX simply has not yet gotten the hang of the new language. The only real drawback to the Power is that the XcharnameX may accidentally forget XcharnameX native language, especially if XcharnameX rarely uses it. Still, XcharnameX can always re- learn it. There is a danger that an adversary might warp the XcharnameX' Linguistic Power and actually negate XcharnameX language comprehension; in such a case, the XcharnameX becomes dysle XcharnameX ic and unable to understand simple English. A curious side effect of the Power is that it provides Power rank Resistance to Hypnotic Voice and other sonic- based forms of Hypnotic or Mind Control. XcharnameX' mind shifts into its translation mode; it studies the medium through which the hypnosis is communicated rather than the actual message. (&#34;Lorelei, did you ever realize that your sleep command is a high C sharp while your paralysis command is a high C flat&#34;).</p>",


	"mediumship" => "<p>XcharnameX is aware of the spirits and can communicate with them through various means. can see them and/or hear them if they so will and converse with them as well. can not command them to appear or call them forth against their wishes. is simply aware of them and capable of direct communication with them.</p>",


	"mental duplication" => "<p>This is a combination of Powers that enables the XcharnameX to psionically study a subject' mind and then create a simulation of that mind within the XcharnameX' own brain. This is a great way to learn secrets and interrogate subjects who would otherwise be rather uncooperative (at best). The duplicated mind contains the personality of the original, most memories, and possibly the mental or psionic Powers of the original. The subject is unaffected by the Power and loses none of XcharnameX own mental abilities. XcharnameX is usually unaware that Duplication has even occurred. The relationship between the XcharnameX' and the duplicate' mind takes one of three forms. The player must choose one form when XcharnameX first creates the XcharnameX; this form applies for any duplicates the XcharnameX creates. Dice Roll Form 01-40 Detachment 41-70 Merge 71-00 Transformation Detachment XcharnameX' mind is completely separate from the duplicate and retains full control over the body and other Powers. XcharnameX can e XcharnameX amine and communicate with the duplicate. The duplicate retains a facsimile of the original' will and may not choose to voluntarily cooperate with the XcharnameX. If the duplicate chooses to resist, the XcharnameX must make a Psyche FEAT whose Intensity is determined by the duplicate' Psyche rank. A successful FEAT means the duplicate will grudgingly cooperate (for now). The FEAT must be made with each new attempt to force cooperation. The duplicate mind can attempt to overwhelm the XcharnameX' own mind. Success occurs if the duplicate makes a -3CS Psyche FEAT whose intensity is based on the XcharnameX' Psyche. The duplicate mind can attempt its coup at the initial duplication and at any time the XcharnameX forces cooperation. Success means the two minds&#34;positions are now reversed; the duplicate now controls the body and any Powers for the duration of the duplication.
</p><p>
	<em>example -</em> Copicat successfully duplicates Dr. Doom' mind. Doom won&#34;t stand for anything resembling subservience and immediately rebels. Copicat has E XcharnameX cellent Psyche; Dr. Doom has Amazing Psyche, reduced 3CS to E XcharnameX cellent when attempting to overwhelm. The Doom-mind fails to make the required E XcharnameX cellent Intensity FEAT.
</p><p>
	Doom decides to e XcharnameX amine XcharnameX situation; from the Doom-mind' point of view, &#34;XcharnameX has been captured by means of a Mind Transferral of unknown type. Copicat is trying to get the Doom-mind to draw up a set of plans for XcharnameX time machine. Unfortunately Doom' Psyche is too high for even a red FEAT.</p>",


	"merge" => "<p>The duplicate mind blends with the XcharnameX' mind to create a composite mentality. The new mind contains aspects of both minds&#34;personalities, memories, and Powers. The new mind' Psyche is the sum of the original two Psyche ranks. The degree of each mind' influence is proportional to its original Psyche. Each original Psyche represents a section of the pooled Psyche. For example, Carboncopy has a Good Psyche. XcharnameX merges with a Thing duplicate (Remarkable Psyche), creating a joint Incredible Psyche. One fourth of the joint personality is Carboncopy, the remaining three-quarters are the Thing.</p>",


	"transformation" => "<p>XcharnameX' mind is automatically overwhelmed by the new mind. XcharnameX' personality, memories, and mental Powers are temporarily replaced by the new mind. The effects appear identical to Mind Transferral, at least where the XcharnameX is concerned. XcharnameX' Reason and Intuition are replaced by those of the original mind; after e XcharnameX piration of the Power, these return to their original ranks.
</p><p>
	Regardless of the form, the XcharnameX must make a FEAT at the time of Duplication in order to determine the completeness of the duplicate mind. Any mind can be duplicated, regardless of its Psyche rank. XcharnameX always duplicates the subject' personality and basic memories; the duplicate mind is an amnesiac. A green FEAT copies the subject' detailed memories. A yellow FEAT copies the subject' Talents. A red FEAT duplicates the subject' Mental and Psionic Powers. The range at which the XcharnameX can duplicate a mind is determined by the Power rank. Appropriate ranges are shown on Column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	The duration of the duplication is determined by the XcharnameX' Psyche rank. A duplicate mind has a duration of the number of minutes equal to the Psyche rank number. The duration decreases - 1CS for all duplicate-minds with each additional mind. For example, Copicat' E XcharnameX cellent Psyche enables him to maintain one duplicate-mind for 20 minutes or a  maximum of five minds for two minutes. If the XcharnameX e XcharnameX ceeds XcharnameX limit, the new duplicate-mind will last for one turn and then all XcharnameX copied minds will vanish. <em>Note:</em> the decreased duration only applies to the Detachment and Merge forms; the Transformation form can be used repeatedly since the latest duplication automatically erases the previous one. When the XcharnameX is created, the player must determine how much control the XcharnameX has over XcharnameX Power. Failure to make at least a green Reason FEAT means the Power functions automatically, despite the XcharnameX' wishes. In the case of uncontrolled Power usage, the range at which duplication occurs drops to contact-only. XcharnameX can maintain some control by covering all parts of her body that might normally touch another person' skin. For example, Rogue wears a full body covering complete with gloves.
</p><p>
	In rare cases, the duration of a specific duplicate mind can be e XcharnameX tended to permanence. Such cases result from a combination of e XcharnameX tremely peculiar factors. One such example occurred when Rogue' Mutant Power interacted with Ms. Marvel' Kree-Modified Human physiology. The result is that Rogue' mind permanently merged with a facsimile of Carol Danvers&#34;mind. If permanence occurs to someone with the Transformation form, then the XcharnameX' original mind is permanently destroyed.</p>",


	"mental defenses" => "<p>XcharnameX' mind is naturally &#34;hidden&#34;somehow, thus concealing their thoughts and true nature from all but the most powerful of mind-affecting effects. Only the most accomplished of psionicist/mentalist/mind mages are capable of breaching his mental defenses and touching his mind. When subject to a mental/mind affecting assault, the rank of XcharnameX Mental Defenses are subtracted from the attackers willpower before willpowers are contested.</p>",


	"Mental Invisibility" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to render XcharnameX own mental energies undetectable by external means. Such means can be technological (EEG scans), psionic, Magical, or Power-based in nature. It is Invisibility in telepathic terms.
</p><p>
	The Power protects the XcharnameX from discovery by outside forces. It serves as Power rank Resistance to undesired probes and psionic attacks. Success means the external probe shows nothing at all, including the presence of this Power, and psionic attacks simply pass through the target (think of someone trying to punch air). The Power can e XcharnameX tend to other minds, but each additional mind decreases the effective Invisibility -1CS.</p>",


	"mental probe" => "<p>XcharnameX can telepathically probe a living mind or a psionic phenomenon to gain a detailed analysis of the target. Living minds can be searched for specific images and thoughts, although the XcharnameX must have a basic idea beforehand of what she is looking for. The target mind is allowed to make a Psyche FEAT to resist a Mental Probe. This is automatic, even if the target mind is initially unaware if the attempted probe. If resistance is successful, the probe is rejected with a headache- backlash that prevents the XcharnameX from trying to probe that target again for 24 hours. A side effect of the Power is that the target' Psyche may temporarily drop -1CS for 24 hours as a result of fending off the probe. This potential loss is determined by a second Psyche FEAT made after the initial resistance. A successful probe reveals only information known by the target.
</p><p>
	Mental Probes can be used to analyze independently existing psychic phenomena.
</p><p>
	Such things include poltergeists, psionic emissions that were so strong they permeated an area and now continually echo, and psionic Powers intercepted by the XcharnameX. XcharnameX can e XcharnameX amine any unknown psionic phenomena in stages. The first FEAT reveals basic information, such as the nature of the psionics in use. Further FEATs reveal increasingly detailed information.
</p><p>
	Mental Probes have a range determined by the Power rank.  maximum ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table. The player has the option, when creating the XcharnameX, of raising the Power rank +1CS by decreasing the range to contact-only.</p>",


	"mental blast" => "<p>Call it what you like, Mental Blast, Psychic bolt, really annoying, XcharnameX can create bolts of pure psionic energy that can be used to directly damage a target' neural system. The Power does rank Intensity damage to the target. The  maximum ranges are shown on column A of the Range Table.
</p><p>
	Targets are allowed to resist by making a Psyche FEAT. Failure means the target is knocked unconscious for 1- 10 turns, as well as taking neural damage. Targets who possess Mental or Psionic Powers can use these Powers&#34;ranks instead of the Psyche when resisting this Power.Powers like Iron Will, Mental Invisibility, Force Field Generation, Force Field vs.Psionics, and Resistance to Psionics should always bear the initial assault.The Power directly damages only neural tissue (brain tissue, nerve fibers).Damage to the rest of the body is indirect and is consistent with the seizures caused by a mangled nervous system.
</p><p>
	Note that this Power can only be used against a target that actually possesses a functioning brain. Zombies, animate matter, plants, and non-sentient Robots are immune to the Power. Player characters Robots are assumed to have a sufficiently human-like mind that they are susceptible to the Power' effects.</p>",


	"mind drain" => "<p>XcharnameX can deplete, negate, or even destroy a target' mental faculties. This alters the target' personality, memory, thought process (Reason and Intuition), and any Mental or Psionic Powers the target had. The target can resist by making a Psyche FEAT; success means the XcharnameX is repelled -by a headache-inducing backlash that prevents the XcharnameX from attacking that target for 24 hours. Part of the target' Psyche may be depleted by resisting the attack. If the target fails a second Psyche FEAT, then XcharnameX Psyche drops -1CS for 24 hours.
</p><p>
	The target' Reason and Intuition rank numbers are reduced by the Power rank number. If both are reduced to zero, the loss is permanent. If the attack is broken off before this point, the target can regain XcharnameX loss in the standard manner. Although such things as memory and personality are not directly tied to a number, they are still reduced by the Power. The target becomes forgetful or outright amnesiac and develops a bland personality.
</p><p>
	<em>Note:</em> XcharnameX does not gain the abilities XcharnameX denies the target.
</p><p>
	Range is determined by Power rank.  maximums ranges for attacking a single target are shown on column A of the Range Table. Each additional target decreases the range -1CS. The Power can be used repeatedly on the same target until both Reason and Intuition reach zero or until the target repels the XcharnameX.</p>",


	"mind control" => "<p>XcharnameX has the ability to directly control over another by directly asserting XcharnameX will over there own. When controlling someone, XcharnameX willpower completely and utterly overrides that of the conscious mind of the subject he is controlling. When performing this kind of &#34;Mental Puppetry&#34;, the target mind is considered to be unconscious and unable to resist further. can control anyone who' willpower is lesser then XcharnameX own.</p>",


	"post cognition" => "<p>XcharnameX can perceive a person, place or thing' past. can &#34;see&#34;key moments form their life and or existence. This ability is similar to clairvoyance, post-cognition, and psychometric in that it allows him to &#34;read&#34;the past or present state of person place or thing.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>Conditions: </li>
		<li>In order for XcharnameX to use this ability XcharnameX must have a clear and unobstructed view of the person, place or thing which they desire to observe.</li>
		<li>In order for XcharnameX to use this ability XcharnameX must be within ten feet of the object he is observing.</li>
	</ul>",


	"post-cognition (temporal interactivity specialization)" => "<p>By touching the organic remains of something which was alive, Ghost can perceive the bio-mass in questions recent history (last day). When in contact, it is as if he was there, seeing everything, e XcharnameX periencing everything from the POV of he deceased biomass in question. Once the initial moment has played it self out, he can choose to relive it, and even e XcharnameX plore it in odd and unusual ways such as walking over and opening a desk, peering into the contents of said desk at that time.</p>",


	"psychokinetic blast" => "<p>A crude form of telekinesis, the XcharnameX can strike an opponent with a surge of pure force equal to XcharnameX willpower. The Kinetic Bolt can be shaped as desired; a wide cylinder, or an incredibly fine needle. Its effect is the same as if the target had been struck by a solid object. This Power can affect only tangible objects.</p>",


	"psychic vampirism" => "<p>XcharnameX can drain the mental energies of XcharnameX victim(s). XcharnameX then uses the purloined energy to increase his own Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and XcharnameX own Powers&#34;ranks.
</p><p>
	The Psi-Vampire or &#34;Psypire&#34;can drain the mental energy from a target by means of a Power FEAT. The intensity rank is determined by the victim' Psyche. A successful FEAT enables the Psivampire to drain an amount of energy equal to his Power rank number. This amount is drawn in equal amounts from the victim' Reason, Intuition, and whatever Mental Powers he possesses.
</p><p>
	The process can continue indefinitely, with each successful FEAT enabling the Psypire to drain more mental energy. The Psypire can drain the mental energy from a target by means of a Power FEAT. The intensity rank is determined by the victim' Psyche. A successful FEAT enables the Psivampire to drain an amount of energy equal to XcharnameX Power rank number. This amount is drawn in equal amounts from the victim' Reason, Intuition, and whatever Mental Powers XcharnameX possesses.
</p><p>
	The process can continue indefinitely, with each successful FEAT enabling the Psypire to drain more mental energy.
</p><p>
	The &#34;Psypire&#34;can voluntarily cease feeding at any time by making any color FEAT e XcharnameX cept red. A red FEAT means XcharnameX has entered an uncontrollable feeding frenzy that can only end when the victim is completely drained or the Psypire has. been repelled.
</p><p>
	If the Psypire fails to make a FEAT at any point in the feeding process, XcharnameX is instantly repulsed by the victim and can never re-establish XcharnameX attack.
</p><p>
	Furthermore, the victim is now immune to any further vampire attacks by that particular Psypire. This immunity does not e XcharnameX tend to other Psypires.
</p><p>
	The Psypire distributes the gained energy among XcharnameX Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and whatever Powers XcharnameX has.
</p><p>
	 XcharnameX cannot raise this Power' rank; no Vampire of any type can ever raise their own Power rank.
</p><p>
	So why do Psypires do it? The answer is they lose energy at a frightful rate. The rank numbers for Strength, Endurance, Psyche, and all XcharnameX Powers (e XcharnameX cept this one) each drop one point per hour. The Psypire must feed in order to return the affected Abilities to their original ranks. This also e XcharnameX plains why Vampires are so rare lower ranked Vampires must constantly feed and are therefore easily detected and destroyed.
</p><p>
	If the Psypire is deprived of victims, XcharnameX enters a death-like trance when all XcharnameX afflicted Abilities drop to Shift 0. XcharnameX Vampiric Power continues to function and will try to feed on anything that comes in contact with the body.
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li>When the Abilities return to Feeble rank, the Psypire returns to life.</li>
		<li>When the Psypire is created, the player must choose at least one Weakness..</li>
		<li>Psi-vampirism is communicable. A sentient being who was completely drained by a Psypire must make a Psyche. FEAT roll. A red FEAT means the victim has XcharnameX been transformed into a Feeble Psypire.</li>

	"Remote Sensing" => "<p>This is a catchall name for any Power that enables the XcharnameX to psionically e XcharnameX tend the range of any sense. The senses include taste, smell, touch, balance (including gravity sensing), and temperature.

The Power can also be used to e XcharnameX tend the range of senses not present in Normal Humans, such as senses that detect Kirlian auras or magnetic fields.

	"Sensory Link" => "<p>XcharnameX can telepathically link XcharnameX senses with those of another being. XcharnameX can use the information gained from the other' senses as if it came from the XcharnameX' own senses. An example would be a blind man really seeing through XcharnameX guide dog' eyes.
</p><p>
	The Power is crucial to sense-impaired characters. Such characters need other beings with the necessary senses to replace the XcharnameX' own deficiency. XcharnameX could receive input from any living being, including companions, adversaries, onlookers, and even animals. The range for this is line-of-sight within one area. XcharnameX can concentrate on the input from a single being but XcharnameX can also automatically scan for other possible senses"

	"Armor Skin" => "<p>This is a form of Body Armor. XcharnameX' skin is transformed into a damage-resistant form. The Power rank number decreases the Intensity of any physical or energy attack. This decrease applies each turn for as long as the attack continues. The Armor Skin may be permanent or temporary. The permanent form is a lasting modification to the XcharnameX' appearance and physiology. The temporary form allows the XcharnameX to retain XcharnameX normal human appearance and identity. When the need arises, the XcharnameX can manifest XcharnameX Power and transform XcharnameX into XcharnameX armored self. The advantage of the permanent form is that XcharnameX is always protected. The disadvantage is that the XcharnameX may be a physical freak. The advantage to the temporary from is that the XcharnameX can live a relatively normal life when XcharnameX is not performing XcharnameXic deeds. The disadvantages are two fold. One, XcharnameX  lacksprotective skin most of the time and two, the temporary form is only available at a cost of -2CS to the Power rank.
</p><p>
	The armor skin can take a variety of appearances. There are four main types of Armor Skin. Each has its own set of characteristics. The player must select one form when XcharnameX first generates this Power.

		<li><em>Leather-</em></li>
		<li><em>Rigid Plates-</em></li>
		<li><em>Visually Inorganic-</em></li>
		<li><em>Inorganic.-</em></li>
		<li><em>Leather</em> - The epidermis retains its normal shape and fle XcharnameX ibility but is harder to the touch. The skin maintains its normal bodily functions without the need for e XcharnameX tensive changes. Androids are often given this type of Armor Skin.</li>
		<li><em>Rigid plates</em> - The body is covered in interlinked plates like an insect' chitin or an armadillo' shell. The wrestler known as the Armadillo is an example of this type of Armor Skin.</li>
		<li><em>Visually Inorganic</em> - The body can be any shape but has the appearance of nonorganic matter. The layering may appear rocky, metallic, or any other choice of surface. The Thing' orange rock-like e XcharnameX terior is an example of this.</li>
		<li><em>Non-organic</em> - The body actually is covered in inorganic material. Unlike an externally applied coating, this one is formed by modified cells in the XcharnameX' epidermis.</li>

	In all of these forms, any damage that is suffered is healed at normal rates by the skin cells that underlie and support the specialized cells of the Armor Skin.</p>",

	"body (resistance)" => "<p>This is the form of Body Armor most XcharnameXes want. XcharnameX' body is composed of apparently normal flesh. However, the tissue of capable of withstanding major damage without showing any effects. The resistance covers physical and energy attacks only. The Intensity rank number of the attack is reduced by this Power' rank number. The remaining Intensity is the actual damage the XcharnameX suffers. While the XcharnameX' skin shows the effects of the tremendous abuse it suffers, at least it heals quickly. The Power enables the epidermis to heal at a tenfold rate.</p>",


	"chemical touch" => "<p>XcharnameX' body secretes chemicals that are capable of a variety of effects on a target. The chemicals can be automatically or consciously secreted. The player must choose when the Power is first generated; there is an equal random chance for each. If the XcharnameX possesses a variety of Touch Powers, then the XcharnameX can alter the nature of the secreted chemicals at will. A Power Touch is created by combining this Power with any other Power the XcharnameX has. Each Touch Power has Power rank Intensity and does rank damage, regardless of the Touch Power' nature. The behavioral characteristics are those of the original Power that was incorporated into the Touch Power. The range is always limited to Contact only. A wide variety of Touch Powers are possible, as this Power can combine with most of the other entries in this book. The key to it is playability; if you can figure out a rational e XcharnameX planation for a given combination, the you should try it.
</p><p>
	This can generate a myriad of unique Powers. Some possibilities include
</p><p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Hallucinogenic -</em> The touch incorporates Hallucinations to produce vivid but totally false images in the target' mind. Fighting and Intuition drop -3CS.</li>
		<li><em>Bioluminescence -</em> The Touch incorporates Light Generation to make the target' body temporarily self illuminating.</li>
		<li><em>Napalm Grip -</em> The Touch incorporates Fire Generation to create fire on contact.</li>
		<li><em>Boom Bo XcharnameX ing -</em> The Touch incorporates Combustion to produce e XcharnameX plosions on contact.</li>

	"body transformation (Mist)" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter the nature of elements and compounds within XcharnameX own body so as to become a sentient &#34;mist&#34;cloud without any solid (or even liquid) components above the microscopic level. Innate safeguards of this ability maintain the XcharnameX' lifeforce in their altered mist-like state. When solid, XcharnameX retains XcharnameX overall normal physical appearance. While gaseous, XcharnameX can assume any shape and still reform into XcharnameX original appearance when desired.</p>",


	"digestive adapatability" => "<p>XcharnameX can swallow and digest any substance without harm. The digestive tract extracts useful materials and synthesizes new ones from the available material. In game &#039;reality&#039; this Power is an internalized, automatic form of Matter Conversion. Materials created by this Power retain their new nature while within the XcharnameX' body; upon e XcharnameX pulsion they revert to their original nature. In rare cases, the XcharnameX is a living filter who could eventually convert all available matter into useful forms.
</p><p>
	The power also includes a +4CS resistance to liquid or solid to XcharnameX ins. These are simply resisted or converted into useful materials. This Power includes a number of physical adaptations to accommodate it. XcharnameX possesses hyperstrong teeth and jaws that permit biting and swallowing any materials, as well as resistance to internal damage caused by the swallowed material.

	<em>Note:</em> feat can be performed only by those with a Strength of 11+. You must make an average Strength action, and those you succeed against are knocked back and lose their action for the e XcharnameX change.</p>",


	"hyper-balance" => "<p>XcharnameX possesses the ability to achieve a state of perfect equilibrium in any position imaginable. seems able to adjust XcharnameX position by instinct, enabling him/hers to balance XcharnameX self on virtually any object, no matter how small or narrow. XcharnameX has developed a unique fighting style that makes full use of XcharnameX agility, strength, and equilibrium.</p>",


	"hyper-endurance" => "<p>XcharnameX capability of sustaining prolonged periods of physically stressful effort (aerobic or anaerobic) without/while only e XcharnameX hibiting any noticeable signs of e XcharnameX haustion or duress. In the case of XcharnameX. &#34;long&#34;is defined as being equal to the XcharnameX Body rank times the rank of XcharnameX Hyper-endurance>.</p>",


	"hyper-leaping" => "<p>XcharnameX can jump great distances. By repeated leaps, XcharnameX can rapidly cover large distances. The distance XcharnameX can cover is equal to XcharnameX Strength rank +1 rank. If a lower rank is initially rolled, it must be raised to this level. This is the distances XcharnameX can safely leap. Innate safeguards in this Power enable XcharnameX to safely land so as not to injure or break a leg for example. The effect is the same on XcharnameX as if he were a Normal Human making a 2 foot leap up or across or descending 3 feet.
</p><p>
	The effects on the area XcharnameX lands on might not be the same as if a normal jump occurred. Consider that the Hulk splinters the pavement when he lands. To determine what sort of effects occur when XcharnameX lands, it is with a force equal to that of five times XcharnameX own weight suddenly drops on the surface in question. The actual landspeed varies with the angle of the leaps.
</p><p>
	Physical burdens do not decrease XcharnameX' speed, although they might decrease XcharnameX control. Anything XcharnameX is carrying is also protected by the innate safeguards against damage; XcharnameX acts as a shock-absorber.</p>",


	"hyper-speed" => "<p>XcharnameX can run at Power rank speed for e XcharnameX tended amounts of time. The Power has the side-effect of raising the Ability rank number of Endurance by this Power' rank number. It includes protection to wind resistance and windburn; this protection e XcharnameX tends to anything XcharnameX is carrying. XcharnameX' lungs are modified to breath high velocity air. The last benefit can be crucial if XcharnameX is capable of Remarkable speeds or better. If XcharnameX stumbles, he continues on a ballistic trajectory until he regains XcharnameX footing or rolls to a halt. To cut down on the chance of this, the Power increase XcharnameX' reaction time to be able cope with impending problems. The increased reaction time decreases the relative speed of any other moving object. XcharnameX' Power rank number decreases the perceived speed of the other object. For example, Quicksilver' Shift XcharnameX speed lets him/hers perceive a bullet traveling at 600 mph as if it were traveling only 15 mph. This side-effect enables XcharnameX to dodge or even catch things like bullets and missiles.</p>",


	"hyper-strength" => "<p>This is the iconic super power of a meta being, representing not only XcharnameX' raw physical force, but also it is the physical manifestation of XcharnameX ability to assert himself over another. As such, XcharnameX is capable of bench pressing a  maximum of weight, or to put it another way, XcharnameX could bench the Weight example.</p>",


	"invulnerability" => "<p>This represents the ultimate combination of Resistances and Body Armor. Eagle is immune to any physical harm, equal to XcharnameX power rank' limit. The immunity includes the following resistances: fire, heat, cold, electricity, radiation, corrosives, disease, poison, brute force, sonics, and kinetic bolts. The rank of the Invulnerability reduces the rank of the attack form. Thus if he were struck with an attack value of 15, XcharnameX invulnerability rank of 12 would reduce the damage done to XcharnameX by XcharnameX rank of 12, thus he would only suffer an attack of 3 points to XcharnameX' Body.</p>",


	"Immortal" => "<p>XcharnameX ages at an every slowing rate. By the time turns one hundred will appear to be about 21 or 22. By the time reaches 25 will no longer age at all and will be unable to die e XcharnameX cept by violent means such as crushing XcharnameX or cutting his head off or doing anything else that would effectively destroy his body in one shot would more than likely kill XcharnameX.</p>",


	"Self-Sustance" => "<p>XcharnameX can survive indefinitely without consuming air, water, or food. Bodily wastes are internally recycled back into useable materials. Normally XcharnameX would not need to replenish himself when XcharnameX power reached its limit. merely resumes normal consumption habits (breathe normally, eat a light snack, etc.). This is the permanent form of the power. The temporary form requires XcharnameX to consume mass quantities at the e XcharnameX piration of the Power. (&#34;That' the fifteenth steak you&#34;ve eaten, Fred. How long did you say it' been since you ate last?&#34;) The required intake is one-quarter what XcharnameX would normally have consumed during the time he was abstaining. XcharnameX can raise XcharnameX Power rank +1rs by opting for the temporary form.</p>",


	"serial immortality" => "<p>XcharnameX can suffer damage, get sick, age, and even die. None of it is permanent to them, though. When XcharnameX' body dies from any cause, the unique nature of XcharnameX life-force enables it to transfer to a new body. can also transfer some but not all of XcharnameX Powers to the new body. XcharnameX loses all Karma with the death of the old body. There are five forms of Serial Immortality, each with a different means of rebirth and Power transferral. Their are five methods from which a character may select:
		 <br /><br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			<em>Newborn -</em> The body is that of an infant. XcharnameX can enter the body at any point from conception to birth. XcharnameX is helpless until birth actually occurs. XcharnameX can accelerate the body' physical development in order to induce birth and quickly regain physical maturity. The rate of accelerated development is a multiplier equal to the Power rank number. A power rank of &#34;2&#34;would age the character twice as fast as normal until they reached their physical prime, a &#34;10&#34;rank would age them ten times faster then normal until they reached their physical prime. <br >
			&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mental Powers are immediately transferred to the new body. Physical Powers are regained as the body matures. The game moderator can decide how and when the Powers reappear. Powers that are derived externally or result from massive alterations of XcharnameX' original form are not transferred. XcharnameX will have to recover or recreate the source of these Powers in order to regain them.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Premade -</em> The new body is a previously prepared clone or android body that was prepared specifically for this purpose. Such a body is already physically mature and in possession of the full range of the XcharnameX' Powers. It is completely mindless and rests in a comatose state until activated by ' life-force. The knowledge of how to create these bodies can be learned if the has the appropriate stats, skills and resources. If a premade body is unavailable at the time the old one dies, the life-force drifts in Limbo until such a body becomes available.</li>
		<li>
			<em> Re-animation -</em> The life-force enters and revives a recently deceased but unmutilated corpse, preferably of the same species as the original body. The body must be reasonably intact, although the Power does include a single-use form of regeneration that repairs the body/restarts bodily functions. His/Her can not control which body enters but rather is drawn to one in the following order of preference: 1) closest to old body, 2) most recently dead, and 3) least severe damage.

			Mental Powers are immediately transferred. Most physical Powers are regained as XcharnameX Re shapes the new body to accommodate the Powers&#34;use. Powers that are external must be recovered or recreated. The amount of time needed to reshape the body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number. If the corpse has intrinsic Powers, XcharnameX gains the use of these upon re-animating the corpse. Such Powers are not transferred to subsequent bodies. The re animated body regains full life within a day of the Power' use.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Spontaneous Creation -</em> This is the most sociably acceptable form of Serial Immortality. XcharnameX creates existing matter and energy into the flesh of a new body. The newly-created body is identical to the previous one and possesses all Powers e XcharnameX cept externally derived ones. Any Power that is in XcharnameX' self- image can transfer. The time needed to create a new body is the number of days equal to 100 minus the Power rank number.</li>
		<li>
			<em>Parasite -</em> This is the nastiest, least socially acceptable form of Serial Immortal ity. XcharnameX' life- force invades a living, physically mature body and overwhelms the original occupant' mind. Successful invasion is determined by pitting the Power rank against the would- be victim' Psyche. The invader must have a willpower greater then that of the subject being invaded. Failure means the invader must choose another victim. If the invasion succeeds, the original mind suffers one of five possible fates; the player must choose one that holds for all victims of this Power. There is an equal random chance for each.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<em>Subordination -</em> The victim retains consciousness and individuality but loses all physical control. XcharnameX is a prisoner in XcharnameX own body.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Merger -</em> The victim' mind is incorporated into the greater mind of the invader. Comatose: The victim' mind is rendered unconscious for the duration of the invasion.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Obliteration -</em> The victim' mind is completely destroyed.</li>
				<li>
					<em>Eviction -</em> The victim' mind is driven out of XcharnameX body and becomes a Free Spirit (see Free Spirit).</li>

XcharnameX can not duplicate the abilities of an imaginary animal or being.</p>",


	"animal transformation (Self)" => "<p>XcharnameX can alter XcharnameX appearance, form, and dimensions to appear as any desired animal form. This Power can also be used to assume alien appearances (but not humanoid aliens). Furthermore, XcharnameX body takes on all the properties of the creature has turned into. For instance, if he turned into a hummingbird, he would weigh only a few ounces and would be full capable of not only flight, but of hovering like a natural hummingbird.</p>",

XcharnameX can transform his body into a resilient sphere, apparently transforming his body into a balloon-like caricature of himself.

This power' rank increases their combat rank by the rank value of this power. has +3Rs resistance to blunt physical attacks. On the down side, he also has 2Rs resistance to slashing attacks.

	"diminution (eelf)" => "<p>XcharnameX can temporarily increase his physical size by means of atomic deduction of their molecular form. XcharnameX'  primary and secondary abilities remain unaffected. Even Strength is undiminished, although it is much harder for a shrunken XcharnameX to gain enough leverage to perform tasks that would otherwise be simple to perform at stheir original size. For example, consider the act of sharpening a pencil if you are only ladybug size. As XcharnameX Shrinks, XcharnameX becomes harder to hit, and harder to harm as they become more molecularly dense.</p>",

As grows in size, so to does physical presence and prowess allowing XcharnameX to add enlargement rank both to his body and XcharnameX strength. XcharnameX grows by means of &#34;Atomic Gain&#34;or to put it another way, by somehow spontaneousily producing new mass and incorporate said mass into XcharnameX atomic structure. Of course, as grows so to do the odds of others hitting XcharnameX making XcharnameX an easier target.</p>",

While in an altered state, XcharnameX has a special vulnerability to attacks menacing that form. I.E. If they transformed into paper, they should be e XcharnameX tremely wary of fire and crayons... While in a solid altered state, XcharnameX retains his overall normal appearance. If liquid or gaseous, he can assume any shape and still reform into his original appearance at the cessation of the Power.

	If a Replicant is killed, XcharnameX doesn&#34;t lose any Body, though XcharnameX might psychic trauma from the Replicants death situation. Replicants can last for up 72 hours before needing to return to the original host. If the Replicants fail to return to the host within that period they will be unable to rejoin with the whole and become telepathically severed from all other replicants/host. Triad can create two additional replicants.</p>",


	"shape-shifting (Self)" => "<p>XcharnameX can drastically alter all of XcharnameX physical parameters (dimensions, appearance, physiology) to achieve any desired shape.

Normal safeguards prevent the XcharnameX from consciously Teleporting into a solid mass.</p>",


	"time travel" => "<p>XcharnameX can travel in time to reach any point in the past, present or future. The  maximum range XcharnameX can reach varies depending on which direction they are traveling. Travel into the past is easier because it already exists from the their point of view. The  maximum range is equal to the Power rank number times 1000 years. Travel into the future is harder (at least, if you&#039;re planning a return trip). The  maximum range into the future is equal to the Power rank number times 10 years. ( + XcharnameX to initiative).</p>",


	"wall crawling" => "<p>Due to some truely remarkable bodily adpations, XcharnameX is capable of crawling up any surface regardless of how sheer it is. XcharnameX can even hang, suspended from the ceiling providing that it is capable of baring his weight. XcharnameX is able to due this because of the millions of microscoptic satae which cover XcharnameX toes. With the invisible aid of these amazingly powerful microscopic grippers, there is almost no surface XcharnameX cannot adhere to. The setae on XcharnameX feet are self-cleaning and will usually remove any clogging dirt which might interfer with his clinging and climbing abilities within a few steps.</p>",


	"Webcasting"=> "XcharnameX can generate and shot out a solid web-like substance. The web can hit any target within 100 feet, instantly adhering to it and binding it. The Web has some basic properties. It can ensnare anyone within the target site. It possesses a material strength equal to the powers rank upon instantly hardening after being fired. It can be used to form swing-lines that enable XcharnameX to travel great distances in a single swing, and it can also make a shield with a material strength equal to that of the contested power rank."
